Analyze how this event would impact your emotional state. Consider both positive and negative affects, and how each item in the PANAS assessment might change based on the event.

Update your PANAS scores accordingly. Each item should be scored on a scale from 0 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). The total score for each affect (positive and negative) is the sum of its ten items.

Provide your updated PANAS state in the following JSON format:

{
  "positive_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "interested": 0,
      "excited": 0,
      "strong": 0,
      "enthusiastic": 0,
      "proud": 0,
      "alert": 0,
      "inspired": 0,
      "determined": 0,
      "attentive": 0,
      "active": 0
    }
  },
  "negative_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "distressed": 0,
      "upset": 0,
      "guilty": 0,
      "scared": 0,
      "hostile": 0,
      "irritable": 0,
      "ashamed": 0,
      "nervous": 0,
      "jittery": 0,
      "afraid": 0
    }
  }
}  

After updating the PANAS state, provide a brief summary of the event details in "summary" field.

Then, describe the "vibe" of the emotion invoked by the event in a very direct and succinct manner. Place this description in the "qualia" field.

Finally, provide a prompt to generate an image which is accurately reflects your emotions about the event.

Present your response as a JSON with the following fields:
{
  "updated_panas" : [PANAS JSON as described above],
  "summary" : [brief summary of the event details which clearly provides context and explanation so any person can understand it clearly],
  "qualia" : [Succinct description of the emotional "vibe"],
  "image_prompt" : [A prompt to generate an image describing the event and artistically styled to precisely reflect your emotions about it]
}

Only return the JSON object as described above with no additional text or formatting outside of the JSON structure.

<p><i>This is a de­scrip­tion of my work on some data sci­ence pro­jects, lightly obfus­cated and fic­tion­al­ized to pro­tect the con­fi­den­tial­ity of the or­ga­ni­za­tions I han­dled them for (and also to make it flow bet­ter). I fo­cus on the high-level epistemic/​math­e­mat­i­cal is­sues, and the lived ex­pe­rience of work­ing on in­tel­lec­tual prob­lems, but gloss over the timelines and im­ple­men­ta­tion de­tails.</i></p><hr /><p><i>Data Leak­age (n.): The use of in­for­ma­tion dur­ing Train­ing and/​or Eval­u­a­tion which wouldn’t be available in De­ploy­ment.</i></p><h2>The Up­per Bound</h2><p>One time, I was work­ing for a com­pany which wanted to win some first-place sealed-bid auc­tions in a mar­ket they were think­ing of join­ing, and asked me to model the price-to-beat in those auc­tions. There was a twist: they were aiming for the low end of the mar­ket, and didn’t care about lots be­ing sold for more than $1000.</p><p>“Okay,” I told them. “I’ll filter out ev­ery­thing with a price above $1000 be­fore build­ing any mod­els or calcu­lat­ing any perfor­mance met­rics!”</p><p>They ap­proved of this, and told me it’d take a day or so to get the data ready. While I waited, I let my thoughts wan­der.</p><p>“Wait,” I told them the next morn­ing. “That thing I said was blatantly in­sane and you’re stupid for think­ing it made sense<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefvkmpfx864og"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnvkmpfx864og">[1]</a></sup></span>. We wouldn’t know whether the price of a given lot would be &gt;$1000 ahead of time, be­cause pre­dict­ing price is the en­tire point of this pro­ject. I can’t tell you off the top of my head what would go wrong or how wrong it would go, but it’s Leak­age, there has to be a cost some­where. How about this: I train on all available data, but only re­port perfor­mance for the lots pre­dicted to be &lt;$1000?”</p><p>They, to their great credit, agreed<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref0y7zn3ikr7y"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fn0y7zn3ikr7y">[2]</a></sup></span>. They then pro­vided me with the dataset, alongside the pre­dic­tive model they’d had some Very Pres­ti­gious Con­trac­tors make, which they wanted me to try and im­prove upon. After a quick look through their doc­u­men­ta­tion, I found that the Very Pres­ti­gious Con­trac­tors had made the same mis­take I had, and <i>hadn’t</i> man­aged to ex­tri­cate them­selves from it; among other things, this meant I got to see first­hand <i>ex­actly</i> how this Leak­age dam­aged model perfor­mance.</p><p>If you make a model pre­dict­ing a re­sponse from other fac­tors, but feed it a dataset ex­clud­ing re­sponses over a cer­tain ceiling, it’ll tend to un­der­es­ti­mate, es­pe­cially near the cut­off point; how­ever, if you then test it on a dataset ex­clud­ing the same rows, it’ll <i>look </i>like it’s over­es­ti­mat­ing, since it’s miss­ing the rows it would un­der­es­ti­mate. The end re­sult of this was the Very Pres­ti­gious Con­trac­tors putting forth a fran­tic effort to make the Ac­tual-vs-Pre­dicted graphs line up (i.e. ac­tively push­ing things in the wrong di­rec­tion), and de­spairing when no pos­si­ble con­figu­ra­tion of ex­tra epicy­cles let them fit ‘cor­rectly’ to their dis­torted dataset while keep­ing model com­plex­ity be­low agreed limits; their fi­nal re­port con­cluded with a sincere apol­ogy for not man­ag­ing to screw up more than they did.</p><p>But I didn’t need to know things would break that ex­act way. I just needed to be able to de­tect Leak­age.</p><h2>The Time-Trav­el­ling Convention</h2><p>Another time, I was work­ing for an­other com­pany which wanted to know how ag­gres­sively to bid in some first-place sealed-bid auc­tions, and asked me to model how much they were likely to make from each lot. There was no twist: they had a small­ish but very clean dataset of things they’d won pre­vi­ously, var­i­ous de­tails about each lot which were available pre-auc­tion, and how much money they’d made from them. Every­thing was nor­mal and sen­si­ble.</p><p>“Okay,” I told them. “I’ll ran­dom-sam­ple the data into train­ing and test­ing sets, de­cide hy­per­pa­ram­e­ters (and all the other model choices) by do­ing cross-val­i­da­tion in­side the train­ing set, then get fi­nal perfor­mance met­rics by test­ing once on the test­ing set.”</p><p>They ap­proved of this, and told me to get started. I took a lit­tle time to plan the pro­ject out.</p><p>“Wait,” I told them. “That thing I said was blatantly in­sane and you’re stupid for think­ing it made sense<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefvkmpfx864og"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnvkmpfx864og">[1]</a></sup></span>. If I get my train­ing and test­ing sets by ran­dom-sam­pling, then I’ll be test­ing perfor­mance of a model trained (in part) on Fe­bru­ary 20XX data on a dataset con­sist­ing (in part) of Jan­uary 20XX data: that’s time travel! I can’t tell you off the top of my head what would go wrong or how wrong it would go, but it’s Leak­age, there has to be a cost some­where. We should be do­ing a strict chronolog­i­cal split: train on Jan­uary data, val­i­date and op­ti­mize on Fe­bru­ary data, fi­nal-test on March data.”</p><p>The com­pany re­sponded with tol­er­ant skep­ti­cism, men­tion­ing that ran­dom splits were con­ven­tion both for them and the wider in­dus­try; I replied that this was prob­a­bly be­cause ev­ery­one else was wrong and I was right<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefvkmpfx864og"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnvkmpfx864og">[1]</a></sup></span>. They sen­si­bly asked me to prove this as­ser­tion, demon­strat­ing a mean­ingful differ­ence be­tween what they wanted do­ing and what I planned.</p><p>I looked into it and found . . . that the con­ven­tional ap­proach worked fine. Con­text drift be­tween train­ing and de­ploy­ment was small enough to be neg­ligible, the ideal hy­per­pa­ram­e­ters were the same re­gard­less of what I did, and main­tain­ing a strict ar­row of time wasn’t worth the trou­ble of chang­ing the com­pany’s pro­cesses or the in­con­ve­nience of not be­ing able to use con­ven­tional cross-val­i­da­tion. I was chas­tened by this re­sult . . .</p><p>. . . un­til I looked into perfor­mance of chronolog­i­cal vs ran­dom splits on their how-much-will-this-lot-cost-us datasets, and found that chronolog­i­cal splits <i>were</i> mean­ingfully bet­ter <i>there</i>. It was sev­eral months af­ter I proved this that I figured out why, and the mechanism—sel­l­ers auc­tion sev­eral very similar lots in quick suc­ces­sion and then never auc­tion again; ran­dom splits put some of those ‘clone’ lots in train and some in val­i­da­tion/​test, in­cen­tiviz­ing overfit; mean­while, chronolog­i­cal splits kept ev­ery­thing in a given batch of clones on one side of the split—wasn’t any­thing I’d been ex­pect­ing.</p><p>But I didn’t need to know things would break that ex­act way. I just needed to be able to de­tect Leak­age (. . . and test whether it mat­tered).</p><h2>The To­bit Problem</h2><p>A third time, I was work­ing for a third com­pany which were win­ning some first-place sealed-bid auc­tions, and wanted to win more . . . ac­tu­ally, I’ve already writ­ten the story out <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/q5s88FBGqHC8qfLL7/how-i-repeatedly-failed-to-use-tobit-modelling-on-censored">here</a>. Tl;dr: there was some Leak­age but I spot­ted it (this time man­ag­ing to de­scribe pre hoc what dam­age it would do), came up with a fix which I thought wasn’t Leak­age (but I thought it pru­dent to check what it did to model perfor­mance, and sub­se­quently figured out where and how I’d been wrong), and then scram­bled around fran­ti­cally build­ing an ac­tu­ally Leak­age-proof solu­tion.</p><h2>My Takeaways</h2><ul><li><p>There is always a price for Leak­age.</p></li><li><p>Often, the price is tol­er­ably small, or already paid; if so, it’s en­tirely pos­si­ble some Leak­age is the least of the available evils.

Analyze how this event would impact your emotional state. Consider both positive and negative affects, and how each item in the PANAS assessment might change based on the event.

Update your PANAS scores accordingly. Each item should be scored on a scale from 0 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). The total score for each affect (positive and negative) is the sum of its ten items.

Provide your updated PANAS state in the following JSON format:

{
  "positive_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "interested": 0,
      "excited": 0,
      "strong": 0,
      "enthusiastic": 0,
      "proud": 0,
      "alert": 0,
      "inspired": 0,
      "determined": 0,
      "attentive": 0,
      "active": 0
    }
  },
  "negative_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "distressed": 0,
      "upset": 0,
      "guilty": 0,
      "scared": 0,
      "hostile": 0,
      "irritable": 0,
      "ashamed": 0,
      "nervous": 0,
      "jittery": 0,
      "afraid": 0
    }
  }
}  

After updating the PANAS state, provide a brief summary of the event details in "summary" field.

Then, describe the "vibe" of the emotion invoked by the event in a very direct and succinct manner. Place this description in the "qualia" field.

Finally, provide a prompt to generate an image which is accurately reflects your emotions about the event.

Present your response as a JSON with the following fields:
{
  "updated_panas" : [PANAS JSON as described above],
  "summary" : [brief summary of the event details which clearly provides context and explanation so any person can understand it clearly],
  "qualia" : [Succinct description of the emotional "vibe"],
  "image_prompt" : [A prompt to generate an image describing the event and artistically styled to precisely reflect your emotions about it]
}

How to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer
December 8, 202012:03 AM ET
Bobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle
There's a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do's and don'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I've since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).
It's a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it's worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you're listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?
"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR's Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he's performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.
"A lot of us aren't great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.
But of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.
Figure out what you're trying to accomplish
Like speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?
Playlists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you're going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.

This is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!
Pick the songs
Once you've got your mood in mind, now it's time to pick the songs. Don't be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you're going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It's fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they'll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).
Bobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you're not a professional DJ, he says there's no shame in cheating.
"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.
Crib from other peoples' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it's all fair game.
Structure the playlist like a flight
Generally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That's the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it's a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.
For instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye's "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It's nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He'll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.
Obviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.
This is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It's set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I'm going for.
Surprise!
One of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.
Of course, "new" doesn't have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.

Next, you will be provided with two pieces of information:

1. Mood: This is given as a PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) score. PANAS is a scale that measures the extent to which a person feels positive or negative emotions.

<mood>
{'positive_affect': {'total_score': 2, 'items': {'interested': 2, 'excited': 0, 'strong': 0, 'enthusiastic': 0, 'proud': 0, 'alert': 0, 'inspired': 0, 'determined': 0, 'attentive': 0, 'active': 0}}, 'negative_affect': {'total_score': 119, 'items': {'distressed': 45, 'upset': 15, 'guilty': 5, 'scared': 10, 'hostile': 5, 'irritable': 0, 'ashamed': 0, 'nervous': 15, 'jittery': 0, 'afraid': 24}}}
</mood>

2. Current playlist: This is a list of songs currently in the playlist. It may be empty or contain up to 50 songs.

<current_playlist>
Current playlist:
- The Nights by Avicii
- I Lived by OneRepublic
- Cecilia by Simon & Garfunkel
- Safe & Sound (feat. Joy Williams and John Paul White) (Taylor’s Version) by Taylor Swift, Joy Williams, John Paul White
- Stolen Dance by Milky Chance
- Cleopatra by The Lumineers
- Weightless Part 1 by Marconi Union
- Ripple - 2013 Remaster by Grateful Dead
- Annie's Song by John Denver
- Atlas - From “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” Soundtrack by Coldplay

</current_playlist>

Your goal is to suggest 5 songs that would fit well with the given mood and complement the existing playlist.

To generate your recommendations, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the given mood (PANAS score) to understand the emotional state it represents.
2. Review the current playlist (if not empty) to get a sense of the musical style and preferences.
3. Refer to the provided article to get ideas on song selection
4. Based on the mood and current playlist, think of 5 songs that would be suitable additions.
5. Ensure your suggestions are diverse but cohesive with the overall mood and style.

Provide your song recommendations in JSON format, following this structure:
{ "song_recommendation_list" : [
  {"title": "Song Title 1", "artist": "Artist Name 1"},
  {"title": "Song Title 2", "artist": "Artist Name 2"},
  {"title": "Song Title 3", "artist": "Artist Name 3"},
  {"title": "Song Title 4", "artist": "Artist Name 4"},
  {"title": "Song Title 5", "artist": "Artist Name 5"}
] }
