These operations often involve the indiscriminate use of toxic chemicals, such as mercury, which contaminate water sources and pose health risks to local communities. As these miners exploit resources, they undermine ecological systems and contribute to biodiversity loss. The article highlights how these activities are not only harming the environment but also exacerbating social issues, including displacement of indigenous populations and conflict over land rights. Authorities struggle to enforce regulations due to corruption, limited resources, and the remote locations of many mining sites. The economic allure of gold drives many into illegal mining, often in search of quick profits, yet the long-term consequences for both people and the planet are dire. There is an urgent need for sustainable practices and stricter enforcement of laws to protect vulnerable ecosystems and communities. Collaboration between governments, environmental organizations, and local populations is essential to address the challenges posed by illegal gold mining and to promote responsible stewardship of natural resources.'}

The first analogy, likening society to a machine, emphasizes efficiency and functionality, suggesting that various parts work together to maintain order and productivity. This perspective promotes a linear view of progress and problem-solving, often sidelining individual experiences and emotional responses in favor of systemic calculations. In contrast, the second analogy compares society to a living organism, highlighting interconnection, growth, and adaptation. This view acknowledges the importance of empathy and human relationships, suggesting that social progress emerges from collective consciousness and cooperation rather than mere efficiency. The article argues that the machine analogy can create a sense of detachment and disillusionment, while the organism analogy fosters a deeper understanding of community and shared struggles. Ultimately, the author calls for a balance between these analogies, advocating for a more nuanced approach that recognizes both the functional and emotional aspects of human society. By embracing elements from both perspectives, this balanced view can unite individuals, promoting a more compassionate and resilient community, essential for addressing contemporary social challenges."}

<p>This post fo­cuses on philo­soph­i­cal ob­jec­tions to Bayesi­anism as an episte­mol­ogy. I first ex­plain Bayesi­anism and some stan­dard ob­jec­tions to it, then lay out my two main ob­jec­tions (in­spired by ideas in philos­o­phy of sci­ence). A fol­low-up post will spec­u­late about how to for­mal­ize an al­ter­na­tive.</p><h3><strong>De­grees of belief</strong></h3><p>The core idea of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/">Bayesian episte­mol­ogy</a>: we should ideally rea­son by as­sign­ing cre­dences to propo­si­tions which rep­re­sent our de­grees of be­lief that those propo­si­tions are true. (Note that this is differ­ent from Bayesi­anism as a set of statis­ti­cal tech­niques, or Bayesi­anism as an ap­proach to ma­chine learn­ing, which I don’t dis­cuss here.)</p><p>If that seems like a suffi­cient char­ac­ter­i­za­tion to you, you can go ahead and skip to the next sec­tion, where I ex­plain my ob­jec­tions to it. But for those who want a more pre­cise de­scrip­tion of Bayesi­anism, and some ex­ist­ing ob­jec­tions to it, I’ll more speci­fi­cally char­ac­ter­ize it in terms of five sub­claims. Bayesi­anism says that we should ideally rea­son in terms of:</p><ol><li><p>Propo­si­tions which are ei­ther true or false (<strong>clas­si­cal logic</strong>)</p></li><li><p>Each of which is as­signed a cre­dence (<strong>prob­a­bil­ism</strong>)</p></li><li><p>Rep­re­sent­ing sub­jec­tive de­grees of be­lief in their truth (<strong>sub­jec­tivism</strong>)</p></li><li><p>Which at each point in time obey the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms">ax­ioms of prob­a­bil­ity</a> (<strong>static ra­tio­nal­ity</strong>)</p></li><li><p>And are up­dated over time by ap­ply­ing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes’ rule</a> to new ev­i­dence (<strong>rigid em­piri­cism</strong>)</p></li></ol><p>I won’t go into the case <i>for</i> Bayesi­anism here ex­cept to say that it does el­e­gantly for­mal­ize many com­mon-sense in­tu­itions. Bayes’ rule fol­lows di­rectly from <a href="https://oscarbonilla.com/2009/05/visualizing-bayes-theorem/">a straight­for­ward Venn di­a­gram</a>. The ax­ioms of prob­a­bil­ity are pow­er­ful and math­e­mat­i­cally satis­fy­ing. Sub­jec­tive cre­dences seem like the ob­vi­ous way to rep­re­sent our un­cer­tainty about the world. Nev­er­the­less, there are a wide range of al­ter­na­tives to Bayesi­anism, each branch­ing off from the claims listed above at differ­ent points:</p><ol><li><p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-analysis/"><i>Tra­di­tional episte­mol­ogy</i></a> only ac­cepts #1, and re­jects #2. Tra­di­tional episte­mol­o­gists of­ten defend a bi­nary con­cep­tion of knowl­edge—e.g. one defined in terms of jus­tified true be­lief (or a similar crite­rion, like re­li­able be­lief).</p></li><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability"><i>Fre­quen­tism</i></a><i> </i>ac­cepts #1 and #2, but re­jects #3: it doesn’t think that cre­dences should be sub­jec­tive. In­stead, fre­quen­tism holds that cre­dences should cor­re­spond to the rel­a­tive fre­quency of an event in the long term, which is an ob­jec­tive fact about the world. For ex­am­ple, you should as­sign 50% cre­dence that a flipped coin will come up heads, be­cause if you con­tinued flip­ping the coin the pro­por­tion of heads would ap­proach 50%.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/y5GftLezdozEHdXkL/an-intuitive-guide-to-garrabrant-induction"><i>Garrabrant in­duc­tion</i></a> ac­cepts #1 to #3, but re­jects #4. In or­der for cre­dences to obey the ax­ioms of prob­a­bil­ity, all the log­i­cal im­pli­ca­tions of a state­ment must be as­signed the same cre­dence. But this “log­i­cal om­ni­science” is im­pos­si­ble for com­pu­ta­tion­ally-bounded agents like our­selves. So in the Garrabrant in­duc­tion frame­work, cre­dences in­stead con­verge to obey­ing the ax­ioms of prob­a­bil­ity in the limit, with­out guaran­tees that they’re co­her­ent af­ter only limited think­ing time.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/xJyY5QkQvNJpZLJRo/radical-probabilism-1"><i>Rad­i­cal prob­a­bil­ism</i></a> ac­cepts #1 to #4, but re­jects #5. Again, this can be mo­ti­vated by qualms about log­i­cal om­ni­science: if think­ing for longer can iden­tify new im­pli­ca­tions of our ex­ist­ing be­liefs, then our cre­dences some­times need to up­date via a differ­ent mechanism than Bayes’ rule. So rad­i­cal prob­a­bil­ism in­stead al­lows an agent to up­date to any set of stat­i­cally ra­tio­nal cre­dences at any time, even if they’re to­tally differ­ent from its pre­vi­ous cre­dences. The one con­straint is that each cre­dence needs to con­verge over time to a fixed value—i.e. it can’t con­tinue os­cillat­ing in­definitely (oth­er­wise the agent would be vuln­er­a­ble to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_book_theorems">Dutch Book</a>).</p></li></ol><p>It’s not cru­cial whether we clas­sify Garrabrant in­duc­tion and rad­i­cal prob­a­bil­ism as var­i­ants of Bayesi­anism or al­ter­na­tives to it, be­cause my main ob­jec­tion to Bayesi­anism doesn’t fall into any of the above cat­e­gories. In­stead, I think we need to go back to ba­sics and re­ject #1. Speci­fi­cally, I have two ob­jec­tions to the idea that ideal­ized rea­son­ing should be un­der­stood in terms of propo­si­tions that are true or false:</p><ol><li><p>We should as­sign truth-val­ues that are in­ter­me­di­ate be­tween true and false (<strong>fuzzy truth-val­ues</strong>)</p></li><li><p>We should rea­son in terms of <i>mod­els</i> rather than propo­si­tions (the <strong>se­man­tic view</strong>)</p></li></ol><p>I’ll defend each claim in turn.</p><h3><strong>De­grees of truth</strong></h3><p>For­mal lan­guages (like code) are only able to ex­press ideas that can be pinned down pre­cisely. Nat­u­ral lan­guages, by con­trast, can re­fer to vague con­cepts which don’t have clear, fixed bound­aries. For ex­am­ple, the truth-val­ues of propo­si­tions which con­tain <a href="https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/grammar/b1-b2-grammar/adjectives-gradable-non-gradable">grad­able ad­jec­tives</a> like “large” or “quiet” or “happy” de­pend on how we in­ter­pret those ad­jec­tives. In­tu­itively speak­ing, a de­scrip­tion of some­thing as “large” can be more or less true de­pend­ing on how large it ac­tu­ally is. The most com­mon way to for­mu­late this spec­trum is as “fuzzy” truth-val­ues which range from 0 to 1. A value close to 1 would be as­signed to claims that are clearly true, and a value close to 0 would be as­signed to claims that are clearly false, with claims that are “kinda true” in the mid­dle.</p><p>Another type of “kinda true” state­ments are ap­prox­i­ma­tions. For ex­am­ple, if I claim that there’s a gro­cery store 500 me­ters away from my house, that’s prob­a­bly true in an <i>ap­prox­i­mate</i> sense, but false in a <i>pre­cise</i> sense. But once we start dis­t­in­guish­ing the differ­ent senses that a con­cept can have, it be­comes clear that ba­si­cally <i>any</i> con­cept can have widely di­ver­gent cat­e­gory bound­aries de­pend­ing on the con­text. <a href="https://metarationality.com/refrigerator">A strik­ing ex­am­ple from Chap­man</a>: </p><blockquote><p>A: Is there any wa­ter in the re­friger­a­tor?<br />B: Yes.<br />A: Where? I don’t see it.<br />B: In the cells of the egg­plant.</p></blockquote><p>The claim that there’s wa­ter in the re­friger­a­tor is tech­ni­cally true, but prag­mat­i­cally false. And the con­cept of “wa­ter” is far bet­ter-defined than al­most all ab­stract con­cepts (like the ones I’m us­ing in this post). So we should treat nat­u­ral-lan­guage propo­si­tions as con­text-de­pen­dent by de­fault. But that’s still con­sis­tent with some state­ments be­ing <i>more</i> con­text-de­pen­dent than oth­ers (e.g. the claim that there’s air in my re­friger­a­tor would be true un­der al­most any in­ter­pre­ta­tion). So an­other way we can think about fuzzy truth-val­ues is as a range from “this state­ment is false in al­most any sense” through “this state­ment is true in some senses and false in some senses” to “this state­ment is true in al­most any sense”.</p><p>Note, how­ever, that there’s an asym­me­try be­tween “this state­ment is true in al­most any sense” and “this state­ment is false in al­most any sense”, be­cause the lat­ter can ap­ply to two differ­ent types of claims. Firstly, claims that are mean­ingful but false (“there’s a tiger in my house”). Se­condly, claims that are <i>non­sense</i>—there are just no mean­ingful in­ter­pre­ta­tions of them at all (“col­or­less green ideas sleep fu­ri­ously”). We can of­ten dis­t­in­guish these two types of claims by negat­ing them: “there isn’t a tiger in my house” is true, whereas “col­or­less green ideas don’t sleep fu­ri­ously” is still non­sense. Of course, non­sense is also a mat­ter of de­gree—e.g. metaphors are by de­fault less mean­ingful than con­crete claims, but still not en­tirely non­sense.</p><p>So I’ve mo­ti­vated fuzzy truth-val­ues from four differ­ent an­gles: vague­ness, ap­prox­i­ma­tion, con­text-de­pen­dence, and sense vs non­sense. The key idea be­hind each of them is that con­cepts have fluid and amor­phous cat­e­gory bound­aries (a prop­erty called <a href="https://metarationality.com/nebulosity"><i>neb­u­los­ity</i></a>). How­ever, putting all of these differ­ent as­pects of neb­u­los­ity on the same zero-to-one scale might be an over­sim­plifi­ca­tion. More gen­er­ally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">fuzzy logic</a> has few of the ap­peal­ing prop­er­ties of clas­si­cal logic, and (to my knowl­edge) isn’t very di­rectly use­ful. So I’m not claiming that we should adopt fuzzy logic whole­sale, or that we know what it means for a given propo­si­tion to be X% true in­stead of Y% true (a ques­tion which I’ll come back to in a fol­low-up post). For now, I’m just claiming that there’s an im­por­tant sense in which think­ing in terms of fuzzy truth-val­ues is <i>less wrong</i> (an­other non-bi­nary truth-value) than only think­ing in terms of bi­nary truth-val­ues.</p><h3><strong>Model-based reasoning</strong></h3><p>The in­tu­itions in fa­vor of fuzzy truth-val­ues be­come clearer when we ap­ply them, not just to in­di­vi­d­ual propo­si­tions, but to <i>mod­els</i> of the world. By a model I mean a (math­e­mat­i­cal) struc­ture that at­tempts to de­scribe some as­pect of re­al­ity. For ex­am­ple, a model of the weather might have vari­ables rep­re­sent­ing tem­per­a­ture, pres­sure, and hu­midity at differ­ent lo­ca­tions, and a pro­ce­dure for up­dat­ing them over time. A model of a chem­i­cal re­ac­tion might have vari­ables rep­re­sent­ing the start­ing con­cen­tra­tions of differ­ent re­ac­tants, and a method for de­ter­min­ing the equil­ibrium con­cen­tra­tions. Or, more sim­ply, a model of the Earth might just be a sphere.</p><p>In or­der to pin down the differ­ence be­tween rea­son­ing about propo­si­tions and rea­son­ing about mod­els, philoso­phers of sci­ence have drawn on con­cepts from math­e­mat­i­cal logic. They dis­t­in­guish be­tween the <i>syn­tac­tic</i> con­tent of a the­ory (the ax­ioms of the the­ory) and its <i>se­man­tic</i> con­tent (the mod­els for which those ax­ioms hold). <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structure-scientific-theories/">As an ex­am­ple</a>, con­sider the three ax­ioms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane">pro­jec­tive planes</a>:</p><ol><li><p>For any two points, ex­actly one line lies on both.</p></li><li><p>For any two lines, ex­actly one point lies on both.</p></li><li><p>There ex­ists a set of four points such that no line has more than two of them.</p></li></ol><p>There are in­finitely many mod­els for which these ax­ioms hold; here’s one of the sim­plest:</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="Geometric figure including triangle ACE with interior circle BDF and center point G. Point B is on line segment AC, D is on CE, and F is on AE. G is the center of the circle. Point G is on line segments AD, BE, and CF." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/TyusAoBMjYzGN3eZS/tetojvzadppwmdspoagk" /></p><p>If propo­si­tions and mod­els are two sides of the same coin, does it mat­ter which one we pri­mar­ily rea­son in terms of? I think so, for two rea­sons. Firstly, most mod­els are very difficult to put into propo­si­tional form. We each have im­plicit men­tal mod­els of our friends’ per­son­al­ities, of how liquids flow, of what a given ob­ject feels like, etc, which are far richer than we can ex­press propo­si­tion­ally. The same is true even for many for­mal mod­els—speci­fi­cally those whose in­ter­nal struc­ture doesn’t di­rectly cor­re­spond to the struc­ture of the world. For ex­am­ple, a neu­ral net­work might en­code a great deal of real-world knowl­edge, but even full ac­cess to the weights doesn’t al­low us to ex­tract that knowl­edge di­rectly—the fact that a given weight is 0.3 doesn’t al­low us to claim that any real-world en­tity has the value 0.3.</p><p>What about sci­en­tific mod­els where each el­e­ment of the model <i>is</i> in­tended to cor­re­spond to an as­pect of re­al­ity? For ex­am­ple, what’s the differ­ence be­tween mod­el­ing the Earth as a sphere, and just be­liev­ing the propo­si­tion “the Earth is a sphere”? My an­swer: think­ing in terms of propo­si­tions (known in philos­o­phy of sci­ence as the <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/Suppe_2000.pdf"><i>syn­tac­tic view</i></a>) bi­ases us to­wards as­sign­ing truth val­ues in a <i>re­duc­tion­ist</i> way. This works when you’re us­ing bi­nary truth-val­ues, be­cause they re­late to each other ac­cord­ing to clas­si­cal logic. But when you’re us­ing fuzzy truth-val­ues, the re­la­tion­ships be­tween the truth-val­ues of differ­ent propo­si­tions be­come much more com­pli­cated. And so think­ing in terms of mod­els (known as the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/187834"><i>se­man­tic view</i></a>) is bet­ter be­cause mod­els can be as­signed truth-val­ues in a <i>holis­tic </i>way.</p><p>As an ex­am­ple: “the Earth is a sphere” is mostly true, and “ev­ery point on the sur­face of a sphere is equally far away from its cen­ter” is pre­cisely true. But “ev­ery point on the sur­face of the Earth is equally far away from the Earth’s cen­ter” seems ridicu­lous—e.g. it im­plies that moun­tains don’t ex­ist. The prob­lem here is that rephras­ing a propo­si­tion in log­i­cally equiv­a­lent terms can dra­mat­i­cally af­fect its im­plicit con­text, and there­fore the de­gree of truth we as­sign to it in iso­la­tion.</p><p>The se­man­tic view solves this by sep­a­rat­ing claims about the struc­ture of the model it­self from claims about how the model re­lates to the world. The former are typ­i­cally much less neb­u­lous—claims like “in the spher­i­cal model of the Earth, ev­ery point on the Earth’s sur­face is equally far away from the cen­ter” are straight­for­wardly true. But we can then bring in neb­u­los­ity when talk­ing about the model as a whole—e.g. “my spher­i­cal model of the Earth is closer to the truth than your flat model of the Earth”, or “my spher­i­cal model of the Earth is use­ful for do­ing as­tro­nom­i­cal calcu­la­tions and ter­rible for figur­ing out where to go skiing”. (Note that we can make similar claims about the men­tal mod­els, neu­ral net­works, etc, dis­cussed above.)</p><p>We might then won­der: should we be talk­ing about the truth of en­tire mod­els at all? Or can we just talk about their use­ful­ness in differ­ent con­texts, with­out the con­cept of truth? This is <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/"><i>the</i> ma­jor de­bate in philos­o­phy of sci­ence</a>. I per­son­ally think that in or­der to ex­plain why sci­en­tific the­o­ries can of­ten pre­dict a wide range of differ­ent phe­nom­ena, we need to make claims about how well they de­scribe the struc­ture of re­al­ity—i.e. how true they are. But we should still use de­grees of truth when do­ing so, be­cause even our most pow­er­ful sci­en­tific mod­els aren’t fully true. We know that gen­eral rel­a­tivity isn’t fully true, for ex­am­ple, be­cause it con­flicts with quan­tum me­chan­ics. Even so, it would be ab­surd to call gen­eral rel­a­tivity false, be­cause it clearly de­scribes a ma­jor part of the struc­ture of phys­i­cal re­al­ity. Mean­while New­to­nian me­chan­ics is fur­ther away from the truth than gen­eral rel­a­tivity, but still much closer to the truth than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_physics">Aris­totelian me­chan­ics</a>, which in turn is much closer to the truth than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism">an­i­mism</a>. The gen­eral point I’m try­ing to illus­trate here was <a href="https://hermiene.net/essays-trans/relativity_of_wrong.html">ex­pressed pithily by Asi­mov</a>: “Think­ing that the Earth is flat is wrong. Think­ing that the Earth is a sphere is wrong. But if you think that they’re equally wrong, you’re wronger than both of them put to­gether.”</p><h3><strong>The cor­rect role of Bayesianism</strong></h3><p>The po­si­tion I’ve de­scribed above over­laps sig­nifi­cantly with the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structural-realism/"><i>struc­tural re­al­ist</i></a> po­si­tion in philos­o­phy of sci­ence. How­ever, struc­tural re­al­ism is usu­ally viewed as a stance on how to in­ter­pret sci­en­tific the­o­ries, rather than how to rea­son more gen­er­ally. So the philo­soph­i­cal po­si­tion which best cap­tures the ideas I’ve laid out is prob­a­bly <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/#ProbKnowVeri">Karl Pop­per’s <i>crit­i­cal ra­tio­nal­ism</i></a>. Pop­per was ac­tu­ally the first to try to for­mally define <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisimilitude">a sci­en­tific the­ory’s de­gree of truth</a> (though he was work­ing be­fore the se­man­tic view be­came wide­spread, and there­fore for­mal­ized the­o­ries in terms of propo­si­tions rather than in terms of mod­els). But his at­tempt <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/Entries/truthlikeness/tichy-miller.html">failed on a tech­ni­cal level</a>; and no at­tempt since then has gained wide­spread ac­cep­tance. Mean­while, the field of ma­chine learn­ing eval­u­ates mod­els by their loss, which can be for­mally defined—but the loss of a model is heav­ily de­pen­dent on the data dis­tri­bu­tion on which it’s eval­u­ated. Per­haps the most promis­ing ap­proach to as­sign­ing fuzzy truth-val­ues comes from <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/y5GftLezdozEHdXkL/an-intuitive-guide-to-garrabrant-induction">Garrabrant in­duc­tion</a>, where the “money” earned by in­di­vi­d­ual traders could be in­ter­preted as a met­ric of fuzzy truth. How­ever, these traders can strate­gi­cally in­ter­act with each other, mak­ing them more like agents than typ­i­cal mod­els.</p><p>Where does this leave us? We’ve traded the crisp, math­e­mat­i­cally el­e­gant Bayesian for­mal­ism for fuzzy truth-val­ues that, while in­tu­itively com­pel­ling, we can’t define even in prin­ci­ple. But I’d rather be vaguely right than pre­cisely wrong. Be­cause it fo­cuses on propo­si­tions which are each (al­most en­tirely) true or false, Bayesi­anism is ac­tively mis­lead­ing in do­mains where rea­son­ing well re­quires con­struct­ing and eval­u­at­ing so­phis­ti­cated mod­els (i.e. most of them).</p><p>For ex­am­ple, <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/nj8JKFoLSMEmD3RGp/how-much-evidence-does-it-take">Bayesi­ans mea­sure ev­i­dence in “bits”</a>, where one bit of ev­i­dence rules out half of the space of pos­si­bil­ities. When ask­ing a ques­tion like “<a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/JD7fwtRQ27yc8NoqS/strong-evidence-is-common">is this stranger named Mark?</a>”, bits of ev­i­dence are a use­ful ab­strac­tion: I can get one bit of ev­i­dence sim­ply by learn­ing whether they’re male or fe­male, and a cou­ple more by learn­ing that their name has only one syl­la­ble. Con­versely, <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/MwQRucYo6BZZwjKE7/einstein-s-arrogance">talk­ing in Bayesian terms about dis­cov­er­ing sci­en­tific the­o­ries</a> is non­sense. If ev­ery PhD in fun­da­men­tal physics had con­tributed even one bit of us­able ev­i­dence about how to unify quan­tum physics and gen­eral rel­a­tivity, we’d have solved quan­tum grav­ity many times over by now. But we haven’t, be­cause al­most all of the work of sci­ence is in <i>con­struct­ing</i> so­phis­ti­cated mod­els, which Bayesi­anism says al­most noth­ing about. (For­mal­isms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomonoff%27s_theory_of_inductive_inference">Solomonoff in­duc­tion</a> at­tempt to sidestep this omis­sion by enu­mer­at­ing and simu­lat­ing all com­putable mod­els, but that’s so differ­ent from what any re­al­is­tic agent can do that we should think of it less as ideal­ized cog­ni­tion and more as a differ­ent thing al­to­gether, which just hap­pens to con­verge to the same out­come in the in­finite limit.)</p><p>Mis­takes like these have many down­stream con­se­quences. No­body should be very con­fi­dent about com­plex do­mains that no­body has so­phis­ti­cated mod­els of (like su­per­in­tel­li­gence); but the idea that “<a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/JD7fwtRQ27yc8NoqS/strong-evidence-is-common">strong ev­i­dence is com­mon</a>” helps <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/JD7fwtRQ27yc8NoqS/strong-evidence-is-common#comment-jNtPscXFL634DD47d">jus­tify</a> con­fi­dent claims about them. And with­out a prin­ci­pled dis­tinc­tion be­tween cre­dences that are de­rived from deep, rigor­ous mod­els of the world, and cre­dences that come from vague spec­u­la­tion (and are there­fore sub­ject to huge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightian_uncertainty">Knigh­tian un­cer­tainty</a>), <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/tG9BLyBEiLeRJZvX6/communicating-effectively-under-knightian-norms">it’s hard for pub­lic dis­cus­sions to ac­tu­ally make progress</a>.</p><p>Should I there­fore be a crit­i­cal ra­tio­nal­ist? I do think Pop­per got a lot of things right. But I also get the sense that he (along with Deutsch, his most promi­nent ad­vo­cate) throws the baby out with the bath­wa­ter. There <i>is</i> a great deal of in­sight en­coded in Bayesi­anism which crit­i­cal ra­tio­nal­ists dis­card (e.g. by <a href="https://philosophy.tamucc.edu/index.php/texts/popper-problem-of-induction">re­ject­ing in­duc­tion</a>). A bet­ter ap­proach is to view Bayesi­anism as de­scribing a spe­cial case of episte­mol­ogy, which ap­plies in con­texts sim­ple enough that we’ve already con­structed all rele­vant mod­els or hy­pothe­ses, ex­actly one of which is ex­actly true, and we just need to de­cide be­tween them. In­ter­preted in that limited way, Bayesi­anism is both use­ful (e.g. in pro­vid­ing a frame­work for bets and pre­dic­tion mar­kets) and in­spiring: if we can for­mal­ize this spe­cial case so well, couldn’t we also for­mal­ize the gen­eral case? What would it look like to con­cretely define de­grees of truth? I don’t have a solu­tion, but I’ll out­line some ex­ist­ing at­tempts, and play around with some ideas of my own, in a fol­low-up post.</p>

2024-10-20 04:02:21,655 - system - INFO - Response JSON: {'summary': 'This article critiques Bayesianism as an epistemology, initially defining it as a system where beliefs are assigned credences that reflect degrees of truth. The author lays out five foundational claims of Bayesianism and presents alternative views such as traditional epistemology, frequentism, Garrabrant induction, and radical probabilism. The main objections proposed involve rejecting the binary nature of truth in favor of fuzzy truth-values that allow for a spectrum of truth. Additionally, the author argues for reasoning through models instead of propositions, emphasizing that models capture more nuanced aspects of reality which binary logic fails to address. The distinction between syntactic content (propositions) and semantic content (models) is vital; models can encapsulate complex relationships more accurately than simple propositions. While recognizing the merits of Bayesianism, the article suggests that it should be reserved for easier contexts where all possible hypotheses are known. The author advocates for further exploration of degrees of truth and the need to clarify nuanced reasoning that can better encapsulate empirical complexities in scientific discourse.'}
