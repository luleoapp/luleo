2024-10-16 04:03:43,968 - system - INFO - Response JSON: {'summary': "In a significant escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula, Pyongyang announced its intention to cut all road and railway connections with South Korea, aiming to achieve a 'complete separation' of the two nations. This move is seen as a response to increasing military drills being conducted by South Korea and the United States, which North Korea perceives as aggressive provocations. The North's decision underscores its commitment to a hardline stance in the face of what it views as ongoing hostilities. Moreover, North Korea's regime has emphasized a focus on strengthening its self-reliance and decreasing interdependence with the South. The severance of transportation links aims not only to reinforce physical barriers but also to bolster nationalistic sentiments among its citizens. Observers believe this development could have profound implications for inter-Korean relations, potentially leading to further isolation of the North while also complicating diplomatic efforts for peace talks. As tensions mount, the global community watches closely for reactions from both Seoul and Washington, as well as any implications for regional security dynamics in East Asia."}

These lawsuits bring fresh attention to longstanding issues of accountability and justice for survivors. The plaintiffs allege a range of abuses, contributing to ongoing discussions about the systemic failures in addressing such claims. The legal actions are being pursued under New York's new legislation that allows survivors to file claims outside of standard time limits, offering them a chance to seek redress. Advocates for survivors emphasize the importance of this legislation in providing a platform for those who have suffered in silence due to fear or societal stigma. The cases reflect a broader cultural movement toward addressing and confronting sexual violence, highlighting the necessity for institutional change. As the legal proceedings unfold, they are expected to shed light on the experiences of survivors and potentially reshape public discourse around such allegations. The outcome of these lawsuits could also impact how similar cases are handled in the future, as they challenge the status quo and strive for justice within a framework of empathy and support for survivors."}

<p>I’ve claimed that <a href="https://patrickdfarley.com/wielding-willpower/">Willpower com­pounds</a> and that small wins in the pre­sent make it eas­ier to get big­ger wins in the fu­ture. Un­for­tu­nately, pro­cras­ti­na­tion and laz­i­ness com­pound, too.</p><p>You’re stressed out for some rea­son, so you take the evening off for a YouTube binge. You end up stay­ing awake a lit­tle later than usual and sleep­ing poorly. So the next morn­ing you feel es­pe­cially tired; you snooze a few ex­tra times. In your rushed morn­ing rou­tine you don’t have time to pre­pare for the work meet­ing as much as you’d planned to. So you have lit­tle to con­tribute dur­ing the meet­ing. You feel bad about your perfor­mance. You es­cape from the bad feel­ings with a Twit­ter break. But Twit­ter is freak­ing out. Elon Musk said <i>what?</i> Every­one is weigh­ing in. This is go­ing to oc­cupy you in­ter­mit­tently for the rest of the day. And so on.</p><p><strong>Laz­i­ness has a kind of in­de­pen­dent mo­men­tum to it.</strong> When you’re hav­ing a day like the above, even if you con­sciously com­mit to get­ting back on track, the rut tends to find its way back to you within a cou­ple of hours. Keep this up for a few days and your sleep is ut­terly messed up, and you walk around in a fog. Keep it up for a week or two and you’re fully off your work­out rou­tine. In a month or two, you might have no­tice­ably fallen be­hind on work; you might be ab­sent from your so­cial life; you might’ve visi­bly gained fat or lost mus­cle; you can no longer feel ex­cited about your per­sonal goals be­cause they’re be­hind a pile of mun­dane tasks you need to catch up on first. And so on.</p><p>How do we stop the vi­cious cir­cle?</p><h2><strong>I’m spiral­ing! I’m spiral­ing!</strong></h2><figure><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JBR6AF9Gusv4u6Fwo/injghkyxeeuag4xmtluq" /></figure><p><br />When you’re in a <strong>laz­i­ness death spiral</strong>, it’s hard to do <i>any­thing</i> de­liber­ate. The first and most im­por­tant step, which does take <i>some</i> willpower but not a lot, is to ac­knowl­edge, “I’m in a laz­i­ness death spiral to­day.”</p><p>If you don’t ac­knowl­edge it, here’s what hap­pens: You vaguely no­tice you you’ve been wast­ing time to­day; you feel a twinge of guilt, so you quickly de­cide, “I’m go­ing to turn the rest of the day around, start­ing right now.” And does that work?</p><p>Often it doesn’t! Sure, af­ter a small lapse you can just get back on track, but if enough laz­i­ness mo­men­tum has built up, a mo­men­tary re­ac­tion doesn’t cut it. <strong>De­cid­ing things quickly, in re­sponse to nega­tive emo­tions, is ex­actly how you got into this situ­a­tion!</strong> You’re go­ing to turn it around <i>on a whim</i>? You’ll have a differ­ent whim in the next hour; what then? You need to take a step back and get your mind out­side of the prob­lem.</p><h2><strong>Do what you can</strong></h2><p>The next three sec­tions are three differ­ent courses of ac­tion you can take to get out of a laz­i­ness death spiral. One of them is clearly prefer­able, but I’m writ­ing the al­ter­na­tives, too. When you’re in a low-willpower state, it’s of­ten bad to at­tempt the <i>very best solu­tion</i>—the farther you reach, the harder you can fall. Build­ing a base of “small wins” is the re­li­able way to re­pair your willpower. If you start some­thing lofty and then bail on it, you’re do­ing real dam­age: log­ging an­other willpower failure and as­so­ci­at­ing that “very best solu­tion” with failure.</p><p>Here are the moves:</p><h2><strong>A) Emer­gency recovery</strong></h2><p>If you’re in a laz­i­ness spiral and you <i>need</i> to get out of it <i>right now</i>, there are some mea­sures you can take that, while effec­tive, are not ideal. They are un­sus­tain­able, pro­mote bad habits, or are just gen­er­ally un­healthy. But some­times the need is there: maybe you have a dead­line fast ap­proach­ing (and the dead­line it­self isn’t enough to snap you into ac­tion); maybe your friends or fam­ily need you to take care of some­thing <i>to­day</i>; maybe you were in the mid­dle of an awfully lazy day and a once-in-a-life­time op­por­tu­nity came up, and you just can’t fo­cus enough to act on it.</p><p>Dis­claimer: I be­lieve that <strong>in a well planned life, none of these should ever be nec­es­sary</strong>. I’m only writ­ing them be­cause we are not perfect.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Mo­ti­va­tional videos</strong>: It’s a whole genre of YouTube/​In­sta­gram con­tent. They make tons of this stuff. The male-coded ones have clips of men lift­ing weights and climb­ing moun­tains set to au­dio of David Gog­gins or CT Fletcher yel­ling at you to get to work. The fe­male-coded ones, I’m led to be­lieve, fea­ture beau­tiful and con­fi­dent women giv­ing pos­i­tive af­fir­ma­tions. Th­ese videos do work; they in­spire a cer­tain emo­tional state in their tar­get au­di­ence, and that state pro­vides the men­tal en­ergy to take im­me­di­ate ac­tion. The down­side is that you nat­u­rally build up a tol­er­ance to emo­tional trig­gers over time; you can’t watch the same video ev­ery day be­fore your work­out and ex­pect it to feel the same. The other down­side is that they might not even last very long. Your emo­tional state <i>will</i> change again, maybe sooner than you think.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mu­sic</strong>: Listen to the songs that you as­so­ci­ate with ac­tion. Similarly, this in­spires an emo­tional state. I find that here, too, the effect is short-lived, un­less I keep the playlist go­ing (and some­times you <i>can’t</i> have mu­sic play­ing while fo­cus­ing on the work you need to do).</p></li><li><p><strong>Drugs</strong>: Ingest enough caf­feine to change your headspace. Or take Ad­der­all or some var­i­ant. Don’t listen to me, I don’t know any­thing about drugs. Ob­vi­ously you’ll build up a tol­er­ance over time and ob­vi­ously it’s very bad to de­pend on a sub­stance to perform.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>B) Nat­u­ral recovery</strong></h2><p>What’s the eas­iest way to get out of a spiral, with­out do­ing any­thing dras­tic or un­usual? I find there are times when it’s nat­u­rally eas­ier to change course. And if you wait for them to come, you can pull your­self out of a spiral with­out a her­culean effort of willpower. Then you can an­a­lyze what went wrong and avoid those cir­cum­stances in the fu­ture.</p><h3><strong>Wait for a re­set point</strong></h3><p>For me, wak­ing up in the morn­ing is a men­tal re­set; noth­ing from my headspace the night be­fore re­ally makes it to the morn­ing. Now, bad habits from the night be­fore might’ve given me less sleep, or poor sleep, but I find that my willpower is usu­ally fresh. So when I’m hav­ing an off day, and I no­tice, I might just call the rest of the day a wash and start plan­ning what I’m go­ing to do to­mor­row. Even as I’m caught up in lazy ac­tivity, I’m mak­ing spe­cific plans to be pro­duc­tive to­mor­row. The fact that it’s at a later point in time means I’m think­ing about it for a while, putting more men­tal en­ergy into the plan. That’s the op­po­site of “de­cid­ing on a whim.”</p><p>It also gives me time to re­al­ize, wow, I re­ally don’t en­joy be­ing lazy. In my <a href="https://patrickdfarley.com/new-years-resolutions/">New-Year’s re­s­olu­tion rant</a> I talked about this effect. For those who con­tinu­ally fail their New Year’s re­s­olu­tions:</p><blockquote><p><i>Got a pro­ject you’ve been ex­cited about but afraid to start? Don’t even think about it—don’t en­joy the fan­tasy of it; stop tel­ling your friends about it; pre­tend you never had that in­ten­tion in the first place.</i></p><p><i>In other words, <strong>ag­gres­sively run away from your goals, and re­flect on how mis­er­able it is to live that way</strong>. The re­flec­tion is cru­cial: if you’re self-for­get­ful /​ not mind­ful about it, you’ll risk stay­ing in that state. Do it for a week or two, re­flect on how much it sucks, and in do­ing so you’ll con­di­tion your mind to view the goal as a valuable op­por­tu­nity to es­cape that mis­ery (which it is).</i></p></blockquote><p>Some­times you cog­ni­tively “want” some­thing, but there’s just no men­tal en­ergy be­hind that want. You know some goal or idea is good for you, but you don’t <i>feel</i>, sub­con­sciously and emo­tion­ally, that it’s good for you. Some­times you need to feel it. So, you should go com­pletely with­out the thing for a while, and al­low your­self to feel ir­ri­tated by that con­di­tion.</p><p>This is ac­tu­ally a sneaky form of self-con­trol. <strong>When you no­tice you’ve been lazy, your </strong><i><strong>next im­pulse</strong></i><strong> is to dash into some “pro­duc­tive” task to start “mak­ing up for” the lost time. But this re­in­forces a habit of act­ing on im­pulses.</strong> In a way, it’s more difficult to re­main in the state you’re in and ac­cept the loss. A per­son who can do that can also wake up the next day and be ex­tremely pro­duc­tive.</p><p>What are your nat­u­ral re­set points? Maybe it’s the morn­ing. Maybe it’s when you go to a spe­cific lo­ca­tion. Maybe it’s a spe­cific day of the week. Iden­tify your next re­set point, and then wait pa­tiently for it to come.</p><h3><strong>An­a­lyze the cir­cum­stances that caused it</strong></h3><p>The other part of the nat­u­ral re­cov­ery is to no­tice what started your spiral, so you can avoid it in the fu­ture. You do this anal­y­sis as soon as you’re at a re­set point. Look at your re­cent ac­tivity and ask, “Where did I go off the rails ear­lier?”</p><blockquote><p><i>af­ter a chess game, i open the game re­view, won­der­ing: which move lost me the game? was i win­ning at any point?</i></p><p><i>i need life game re­view at the end of ev­ery day. when did my day go awry? was i on pace to have a pro­duc­tive day at any point?</i></p><p><i>— monk (@me­chan­i­cal_monk) </i><a href="https://twitter.com/mechanical_monk/status/1689631570217537536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"><i>Au­gust 10, 2023</i></a></p></blockquote><p>In do­ing that re­view, you’ll dis­cover how far back the laz­i­ness death spiral goes. “Well it’s cause I got up late to­day. Why was I on my phone so late last night? Oh yeah, that other thing…”</p><p>For me, when I get down to the real origi­nal cause, it’s of­ten some­thing <i>very</i> mun­dane that just hap­pened to oc­cur at the perfect mo­ment to throw me off. A few ex­am­ples:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Food</strong>: I ate a huge meal and it put me into a food coma that I wasn’t pre­pared for.</p></li><li><p><strong>Me­dia</strong>: I watched some­thing a lit­tle too at­ten­tion-grabby, a lit­tle too early in the day. On the spec­trum from art to en­ter­tain­ment—where the art re­quires more men­tal en­ergy to en­joy but de­liv­ers richer value, and en­ter­tain­ment can be en­joyed pas­sively but is cheap value—I mostly only slide to­ward the en­ter­tain­ment side through­out the day. So for ex­am­ple if I play a video game at 6pm, there’s very lit­tle chance I’m go­ing to be con­sum­ing some­thing thought­ful and com­plex at 9pm.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sleep</strong>: This is ac­tu­ally more nu­anced than just “I didn’t get enough”: wak­ing up at the wrong point in your sleep cy­cle makes you feel much grog­gier. In any case, if I wake up feel­ing off and I don’t im­me­di­ately need to be some­where, I’ll drag it out, snooz­ing. And that doesn’t make the grog­gi­ness go away. And al­though I may not miss any ex­plicit plans, it puts me on a lazy bent.</p></li><li><p><strong>De­ci­sion spirals</strong>: I don’t nec­es­sar­ily be­lieve in <i>de­ci­sion fa­tigue</i>, but there’s a cer­tain kind of de­ci­sion that’s ab­solutely dev­as­tat­ing for my pro­duc­tivity. It’s when I have to pick be­tween two pretty bal­anced choices, but there are many lit­tle de­tails to con­sider on each side. The longer you spend think­ing about it, the more dy­nam­ics re­veal them­selves. So it’s kind ad­dict­ing; you hope that if you just view the prob­lem from one more an­gle, some­thing stark will ap­pear and make the choice easy. But the more time you spend, the more cost you have sunk into it, which makes it feel all the more im­por­tant that you de­cide op­ti­mally when you fi­nally de­cide! In short, <a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/i/44314254/choice-hijacks-you-into-choosing-mode">Choices are bad</a>. </p></li></ul><p>So, that’s the nat­u­ral re­cov­ery. It works pretty well, but the down­side is that you can get knocked off again. You might know the ex­act cir­cum­stan­tial trig­gers that caused a spiral last time, but differ­ent ones will come up next time. Some you can miti­gate, but some will keep com­ing at you be­cause, as I said, they’re mun­dane. And that makes me again won­der how some­thing as or­di­nary as a big meal had such a great effect on my day—per­haps some­thing else is go­ing on.</p><h2><strong>C) Heroic recovery</strong></h2><p>The heroic re­cov­ery from a laz­i­ness spiral is harder and takes longer to work, but it solves the prob­lem in a more com­plete way. I have enough fa­mil­iar­ity with this to see how it works, but not a ton of fa­mil­iar­ity. I learn from peo­ple more ma­ture than me; ev­ery day is a jour­ney.</p><p>In short, <strong>the heroic re­cov­ery means deeply an­a­lyz­ing your­self to un­der­stand the root cause of your es­capes to lazy pas­times</strong>—your de­ci­sions to <i>dis­so­ci­ate</i> from what’s go­ing on im­me­di­ately in front of you.</p><h3><strong>Deep psych work</strong></h3><p>Think about the cir­cum­stances be­hind your lapse, like you did in the last sec­tion. Then go deeper and an­a­lyze ex­actly why you re­sponded the way you did. Typ­i­cally, you ex­pe­rienced some minor dis­com­fort, and you es­caped from that dis­com­fort by hi­jack­ing your at­ten­tion with a quick-re­ward ac­tivity. What was the minor dis­com­fort? I don’t mean the trig­ger in phys­i­cal re­al­ity; I mean what was the <i>nega­tive feel­ing</i> that you cut short? And why?</p><blockquote><p><i>most things I’ve read on here so far are about a par­tic­u­lar self-co­er­cion—”mak­ing your­self do things”</i></p><p><i>when part of you is afraid/​up­set/​over­whelmed/​doesn’t-want-to but you push down those feel­ings to “do it any­way”</i></p><p><i>see­ing now, some ways of “not do­ing things” are similar</i></p><p><i>— pre­rat (@pre­ra­tional­ist) </i><a href="https://twitter.com/prerationalist/status/1329141980149010434?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"><i>Novem­ber 18, 2020</i></a></p></blockquote><p>Does the feel­ing go against your self-image in some way?</p><blockquote><p><i>Some of us can go through decades w/​o ever prop­erly com­ing to terms with our feel­ings.

It’s too im­por­tant to do on a laz­i­ness death spiral day, and it can eas­ily be­come an­other part of the spiral: If you’re busy an­a­lyz­ing your re­ac­tion to some feel­ing, you’re not feel­ing it. You’re still avoid­ing it.</p><p>But, if you do enough dig­ging up and sort­ing things out, you start to re-frame these dis­so­ci­a­tion trig­gers, so that even the ones that are out of your con­trol don’t af­fect you the way they used to.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>This has been a very heady post. I no­tice I’m writ­ing very heav­ily from per­sonal ex­pe­rience here—more than usual—be­cause the dy­nam­ics of willpower and laz­i­ness and dis­so­ci­a­tion are very sub­jec­tive. If it doesn’t seem to match your ex­pe­rience, then dis­re­gard it. But if there’s any­one who ex­pe­riences laz­i­ness the same way I do, I might have saved them a lot of trou­ble.</p><p>If you liked this post con­sider sub­scribing to my Sub­stack, <a class="bare-url" href="https://truegeneralist.substack.com/">https://​​true­gen­er­al­ist.sub­stack.com/​​</a>.<br /> </p>

2024-10-16 04:04:34,247 - system - INFO - Response JSON: {'summary': "The article discusses the phenomenon of 'laziness death spirals,' where procrastination and negative habits compound, leading to poor performance and increased stress. It emphasizes that laziness has its own momentum; acknowledging when you're spiraling is crucial. The author proposes three methods for recovery: emergency recovery, natural recovery, and heroic recovery. Emergency recovery involves quick fixes like motivation videos or music, while natural recovery suggests waiting for a reset point, such as a new day, to assess what went wrong without pressure. Analyzing triggers helps avoid future spirals. Heroic recovery, the most profound yet challenging approach, involves deep self-reflection to understand the roots of escapism and discomfort, promoting emotional acceptance. The article underlines the importance of self-awareness and intentional action in breaking cycles of laziness and emphasizes that genuine improvement emerges from understanding oneself and reinforcing willpower through small wins. Ultimately, it advocates for reflective practices to identify and mitigate triggers of laziness, thus enabling one to navigate life's challenges with greater clarity and purpose."}
