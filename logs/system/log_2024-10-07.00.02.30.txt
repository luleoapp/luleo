KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza, Oct 6 (Reuters) - In the ruins of his two-storey home, 11-year-old Mohammed gathers chunks of the fallen roof into a broken pail and pounds them into gravel which his father will use to make gravestones for victims of the Gaza war."We get the rubble not to build houses, no, but for tombstones and graves - from one misery to another," his father, former construction worker Jihad Shamali, 42, says as he cuts through metal salvaged from their home in the southern city of Khan Younis, damaged during an Israeli raid in April.The work is hard, and at times grim. In March, the family built a tomb for one of Shamali's sons, Ismail, killed while running household errands.But it is also a tiny part of the efforts starting to take shape to deal with the rubble left by Israel's military campaign to eliminate Palestinian militant group Hamas.The United Nations estimates there is over 42 million tonnes of debris, including both shattered edifices that are still standing and flattened buildings.That is 14 times the amount of rubble accumulated in Gaza between 2008 and the war's start a year ago, and over five times the amount left by the 2016-17 Battle of Mosul in Iraq, the U.N. said.Piled up, it would fill the Great Pyramid of Giza - Egypt's largest - 11 times. And it is growing daily.The U.N. is trying to help as Gazan authorities consider how to deal with the rubble, three U.N. officials said.A U.N.-led Debris Management Working Group plans a pilot project with Palestinian authorities in Khan Younis and the central Gazan city of Deir El-Balah to start clearing roadside debris this month."The challenges are huge," said Alessandro Mrakic, the Gaza Office head for the United Nations' Development Programme (UNDP) which is co-chairing the working group. "It's going to be a massive operation, but at the same time, it's important that we start now."Israel's military has said Hamas fighters hide among civilians and that it will strike them wherever they emerge, while also trying to avoid harming civilians.Asked about the debris, Israel's military unit COGAT said it aimed to improve waste-handling and would work with the U.N. to expand those efforts. Mrakic said coordination with Israel was excellent but detailed discussions on future plans were yet to take place.TENTS AMID THE RUINSIsrael began its offensive after Hamas militants entered Israel on Oct. 7 last year, killed about 1,200 Israelis and took over 250 people hostage.Nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in a year of conflict, Palestinian health authorities say.On the ground, wreckage is piled high above pedestrians and donkey carts on dusty narrow paths that were once busy roads."Who is going to come here and clear the rubble for us? No-one. Therefore, we did that ourselves," taxi driver Yusri Abu Shabab said, having cleared enough debris from his Khan Younis home to erect a tent.Two-thirds of Gaza's pre-war structures - over 163,000 buildings - have been damaged or flattened, according to U.N. satellite data. Around a third were high-rise buildings.After a seven-week war in Gaza in 2014, UNDP and its partners cleared 3 million tonnes of debris - 7% of the total now. Mrakic cited an unpublished preliminary estimate that it would cost $280 million to clear 10 million tonnes, implying around $1.2 billion if the war stopped now.Item 1 of 5 Palestinians walk past the rubble of houses destroyed during the Israeli military offensive, amid Israel-Hamas conflict, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip July 10, 2024. REUTERS/Hatem Khaled/File Photo[1/5]Palestinians walk past the rubble of houses destroyed during the Israeli military offensive, amid Israel-Hamas conflict, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip July 10, 2024. REUTERS/Hatem Khaled/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabA U.N. estimate from April suggested it would take 14 years to clear the rubble.CONCEALED BODIESThe debris contains unrecovered bodies, as many as 10,000 according to the Palestinian health ministry, and unexploded bombs, Mrakic said.The International Committee of the Red Cross says the threat is "pervasive" and U.N. officials say some of the debris poses a big injury risk.Nizar Zurub, from Khan Younis, lives with his son in a home where only a roof remains, hanging at a precarious angle.The United Nations Environment Programme said an estimated 2.3 million tonnes of debris might be contaminated, citing an assessment of Gaza's eight refugee camps, some of which have been hit.Asbestos fibres can cause larynx, ovarian and lung cancer when inhaled.The World Health Organization has recorded nearly a million cases of acute respiratory infections in Gaza in the past year, without saying how many are linked to dust.WHO spokesperson Bisma Akbar said dust was a "significant concern", and could contaminate water and soil and lead to lung disease.Doctors fear a rise in cancers and birth defects from leaking metals in coming decades. Snake and scorpion bites and skin infections from sandflies are a concern, a UNEP spokesperson said.LAND AND EQUIPMENT SHORTAGESGaza's rubble has previously been used to help build seaports. The U.N. hopes now to recycle a portion for road networks and bolstering the shoreline.Gaza, which had a pre-war population of 2.3 million crammed into an area 45 km (28 miles) long and 10 km wide, lacks the space needed for disposal, the UNDP says.Landfills are now in an Israeli military zone. Israel's COGAT said they were in a restricted area but that access would be granted.More recycling means more money to fund equipment such as industrial crushers, Mrakic said. They would have to enter via crossing points controlled by Israel.Government officials report fuel and machinery shortages because of Israeli restrictions that slow clear-up efforts. The UNEP spokesperson said prolonged approval processes were a "major bottleneck".Israel did not specifically comment on allegations it was restricting machinery.The UNEP says it needs owners' permission to remove debris, yet the scale of destruction has blurred property boundaries, and some property records have been lost during the war.Several donors have expressed interest in helping since a Palestinian government-hosted meeting in the West Bank on Aug. 12, Mrakic said, without naming them.A U.N. official, requesting anonymity to avoid undermining ongoing efforts, said: "Everybody's concerned whether to invest in rebuilding Gaza if there is no political solution in place."

The UN is coordinating with Palestinian authorities to address the debris crisis, planning a pilot project to clear roadside waste.

With only two challengers in the upcoming elections, one of whom is currently imprisoned, Saied faces limited opposition. His administration has been marked by severe restrictions on political freedoms, with the jailing of critics and opposition figures intensifying concerns regarding the state of democracy in Tunisia. Despite Saied's claims of fighting corruption and promoting national interests, his actions have drawn widespread condemnation from human rights organizations and political observers. The political landscape in Tunisia remains heavily skewed in favor of Saied, as many citizens express disillusionment with the electoral process and the lack of viable alternatives. This presents challenges not only for opposition forces but also for the broader goal of democratic consolidation in Tunisia. As the elections approach, the implications of Saied's presidency on the future of Tunisian democracy continue to be a topic of significant concern and debate among citizens and international observers alike."}

BEIRUT, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Massive consecutive strikes hit Beirut's southern suburbs from late Saturday into Sunday, Reuters eyewitnesses said, sending booms across the city and sparking flashes of red and white for nearly 30 minutes visible from several kilometers away.The strikes came after days of bombing by Israel of Beirut suburbs considered strongholds for Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah, killing its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and possibly his potential successor.A Lebanese security source said on Saturday that Hashem Safieddine, the potential successor, had been out of contact since Friday, after an Israeli airstrike near the city's international airport that was reported to have targeted him.The Israeli military said it eliminated Nasrallah in a strike on the group's central command headquarters in Beirut on Sept. 27. Hezbollah confirmed he had been killed.Lebanese security sources said Israeli strikes since Friday on Dahiyeh, a residential area and Hezbollah stronghold south of central Beirut, have kept rescue workers from scouring the site of Thursday night's attack.Hezbollah has made no comment so far on Safieddine.His loss would be another blow to the group and its patron Iran. Israeli strikes across the region in the past year, sharply accelerated in the past few weeks, have decimated Hezbollah's leadership.Israel has been expanding its actions in Lebanon. On Saturday, it made its first strike in the northern city of Tripoli, a Lebanese security official said, and Israeli troops launched raids in the south.At least eight strikes rocked Beirut’s southern suburbs late on Saturday including close to the airport, according to Reuters witnesses, after the Israeli military warned some residents to flee.Before the recent upsurge, exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah had been mostly limited to the Israel-Lebanon border area, in parallel to Israel's year-old war in Gaza against Palestinian group Hamas.Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Saturday that Israel had killed 440 Hezbollah fighters in its ground operations in southern Lebanon and destroyed 2,000 Hezbollah targets. Hezbollah has not released death tolls.Israel says it stepped up its assault on Hezbollah to enable the safe return of tens of thousands of citizens to homes in northern Israel, bombarded by the group since last Oct. 8.Israeli authorities said on Saturday that nine Israeli soldiers had been killed in southern Lebanon so far.CIVILIAN DEATHS, DISPLACEMENTThe Israeli assault has also killed hundreds of ordinary Lebanese, Lebanese officials say, and forced 1.2 million people - almost a quarter of the population - from their homes.The Lebanese security official told Reuters that Saturday's strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Tripoli killed a member of Hamas, his wife and two children. Media affiliated with the Palestinian group said the strike killed a leader of its armed wing, naming him as Saeed Atallah.The Israeli said in a statement that it had killed two Hamas members operating in Lebanon, but did not say whether they had been in Tripoli, a Sunni Muslim-majority port city also targeted during a 2006 war with HezbollahThere was no immediate comment from Hamas.In northern Israel, air raid sirens on Saturday sent people running for shelters amid rocket fire from Lebanon.Hezbollah said it had fired missiles at what it called "ATA company for military industries near Sakhnin base," close to Haifa. It was not immediately clear what Hezbollah was referring to.The Israeli army said two projectiles had crossed from Lebanon, one of which was intercepted while the other landed but caused no damage.ANNIVERSARY OF OCT. 7The violence came as the anniversary approached of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.Israel's subsequent assault on Gaza has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry, and displaced nearly all of the enclave's population of 2.3 million.The impact on civilians has prompted widespread protests internationally. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in major cities around the world on Saturday as the anniversary approached.Iran, which backs both Hezbollah and Hamas, and which has lost key commanders of its elite Revolutionary Guards Corps to Israeli airstrikes this year, launched ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday. The strikes did little damage.Israel has been weighing options for its response.Oil prices have risen on the possibility of an Israeli attack on Iranian oil facilities. U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday urged Israel to consider alternatives to striking Iranian oil infrastructure.The top U.S. general for the region, Army General Michael "Eric" Kurilla, is traveling in the Middle East, a U.S. defense official said on Saturday, declining to specify which country or to confirm Israeli media reports that he had arrived in Israel for consultations with Israeli military officials.

These strikes follow the reported killing of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and the potential successor Hashem Safieddine, with Israeli military operations resulting in substantial casualties within Hezbollah. Israeli authorities have stated that they have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters and destroyed numerous targets since intensifying their assault, which aims to secure the safety of northern Israeli citizens amid retaliatory rocket fire from Hezbollah. The ongoing conflict has led to widespread devastation in Lebanon, displacing 1.2 million residents and causing the deaths of hundreds of civilians. Similar violence has spilled over into Palestinian refugee camps, raising significant humanitarian concerns. As tensions build around the anniversary of Hamas's attack on Israel, international protests against civilian casualties in Gaza and Lebanon have erupted.

The situation remains volatile, with U.S. military officials involved in consultations regarding potential responses to Iranian provocations amid heightened regional tensions."}

These accusations arise amidst ongoing violence and humanitarian concerns in the region. Critics argue that Netanyahu's perceived political calculations may prioritize domestic support over urgent humanitarian needs, reflecting a disconnect with the reality faced by civilians in Gaza. The political context includes upcoming elections in Israel, where Netanyahu may be wary of appearing weak or vulnerable. Additionally, Democrats express frustration over the broader U.S. support for Israel, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that considers the suffering of Palestinians. Advocates for peace urge both Israeli and Palestinian leaders to seek resolutions that prioritize lives and promote stability.
