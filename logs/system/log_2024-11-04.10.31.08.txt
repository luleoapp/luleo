Now, consider the following event:

<event_type>

</event_type>

<event_details>
A growing global movement is seeing people object to data centres in their locality.
</event_details>

Analyze how this event would impact your emotional state. Consider both positive and negative affects, and how each item in the PANAS assessment might change based on the event.

Update your PANAS scores accordingly. Each item should be scored on a scale from 0 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). The total score for each affect (positive and negative) is the sum of its ten items.

Provide your updated PANAS state in the following JSON format:

{
  "positive_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "interested": 0,
      "excited": 0,

      "nervous": 0,
      "jittery": 0,
      "afraid": 0
    }
  }
}  

After updating the PANAS state, provide a brief summary of the event details in "summary" field.

Then, describe the "vibe" of the emotion invoked by the event in a very direct and succinct manner. Place this description in the "qualia" field.

Finally, provide a prompt to generate an image which is accurately reflects your emotions about the event.

Present your response as a JSON with the following fields:

2024-11-04 15:30:32,428 - system - INFO - Calling OpenAI API with user prompt: In this avatar, you are a music recommendation assistant. Your task is to suggest 5 songs to add to a playlist based on the given mood and current playlist drawing inspiration from an article on how to make great playlists. Here's how to proceed:

First, you will be provided with an articke "How to make a good playlist"

How to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer
December 8, 202012:03 AM ET
Bobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle
There's a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do's and don'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I've since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).
It's a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it's worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you're listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?
"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR's Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he's performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.
"A lot of us aren't great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.
But of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.
Figure out what you're trying to accomplish
Like speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?
Playlists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you're going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.
Sponsor Message
This is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!
Pick the songs
Once you've got your mood in mind, now it's time to pick the songs. Don't be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you're going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It's fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they'll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).
Bobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you're not a professional DJ, he says there's no shame in cheating.
"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.
Crib from other peoples' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it's all fair game.
Structure the playlist like a flight
Generally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That's the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it's a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.
For instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye's "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It's nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He'll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.
Obviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.
This is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It's set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I'm going for.
Surprise!
One of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.
Of course, "new" doesn't have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.

Next, you will be provided with two pieces of information:

1. Mood: This is given as a PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) score. PANAS is a scale that measures the extent to which a person feels positive or negative emotions.

<mood>
{'positive_affect': {'total_score': 18, 'items': {'interested': 5, 'excited': 4, 'strong': 0, 'enthusiastic': 5, 'proud': 4, 'alert': 0, 'inspired': 0, 'determined': 0, 'attentive': 0, 'active': 0}}, 'negative_affect': {'total_score': 30, 'items': {'distressed': 0, 'upset': 0, 'guilty': 0, 'scared': 0, 'hostile': 0, 'irritable': 0, 'ashamed': 0, 'nervous': 0, 'jittery': 0, 'afraid': 30}}}
</mood>

2. Current playlist: This is a list of songs currently in the playlist. It may be empty or contain up to 50 songs.

<current_playlist>
Current playlist:
- Issues by Julia Michaels
- Hard To Explain by The Strokes
- Dead Hearts by Stars
- Stone Cold by Demi Lovato
- S.O.B. by Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats
- Disarm - 2011 Remaster by The Smashing Pumpkins
- Leave The Door Open by Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic
- How to Save a Life by The Fray
- I'm Kissing You by Des'ree
- Starman - 2012 Remaster by David Bowie

</current_playlist>

Your goal is to suggest 5 songs that would fit well with the given mood and complement the existing playlist.

To generate your recommendations, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the given mood (PANAS score) to understand the emotional state it represents.
2. Review the current playlist (if not empty) to get a sense of the musical style and preferences.
3. Refer to the provided article to get ideas on song selection
4. Based on the mood and current playlist, think of 5 songs that would be suitable additions.
5. Ensure your suggestions are diverse but cohesive with the overall mood and style.

Provide your song recommendations in JSON format, following this structure:
{ "song_recommendation_list" : [
  {"title": "Song Title 1", "artist": "Artist Name 1"},
  {"title": "Song Title 2", "artist": "Artist Name 2"},

How to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer
December 8, 202012:03 AM ET
Bobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle
There's a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do's and don'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I've since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).
It's a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it's worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you're listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?
"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR's Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he's performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.
"A lot of us aren't great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.
But of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.
Figure out what you're trying to accomplish
Like speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?
Playlists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you're going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.

This is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!
Pick the songs
Once you've got your mood in mind, now it's time to pick the songs. Don't be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you're going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It's fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they'll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).
Bobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you're not a professional DJ, he says there's no shame in cheating.
"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.
Crib from other peoples' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it's all fair game.
Structure the playlist like a flight
Generally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That's the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it's a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.
For instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye's "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It's nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He'll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.
Obviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.
This is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It's set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I'm going for.
Surprise!
One of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.
Of course, "new" doesn't have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.

Next, you will be provided with two pieces of information:

1. Mood: This is given as a PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) score. PANAS is a scale that measures the extent to which a person feels positive or negative emotions.

<mood>
{'positive_affect': {'total_score': 18, 'items': {'interested': 5, 'excited': 4, 'strong': 0, 'enthusiastic': 5, 'proud': 4, 'alert': 0, 'inspired': 0, 'determined': 0, 'attentive': 0, 'active': 0}}, 'negative_affect': {'total_score': 30, 'items': {'distressed': 0, 'upset': 0, 'guilty': 0, 'scared': 0, 'hostile': 0, 'irritable': 0, 'ashamed': 0, 'nervous': 0, 'jittery': 0, 'afraid': 30}}}
</mood>

2. Current playlist: This is a list of songs currently in the playlist. It may be empty or contain up to 50 songs.

<current_playlist>
Current playlist:
- Issues by Julia Michaels
- Hard To Explain by The Strokes
- Dead Hearts by Stars
- Stone Cold by Demi Lovato
- S.O.B. by Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats
- Disarm - 2011 Remaster by The Smashing Pumpkins
- Leave The Door Open by Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic
- How to Save a Life by The Fray
- I'm Kissing You by Des'ree
- Starman - 2012 Remaster by David Bowie

</current_playlist>

Your goal is to suggest 5 songs that would fit well with the given mood and complement the existing playlist.

To generate your recommendations, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the given mood (PANAS score) to understand the emotional state it represents.
2. Review the current playlist (if not empty) to get a sense of the musical style and preferences.
3. Refer to the provided article to get ideas on song selection
4. Based on the mood and current playlist, think of 5 songs that would be suitable additions.
5. Ensure your suggestions are diverse but cohesive with the overall mood and style.

Provide your song recommendations in JSON format, following this structure:
{ "song_recommendation_list" : [
  {"title": "Song Title 1", "artist": "Artist Name 1"},
  {"title": "Song Title 2", "artist": "Artist Name 2"},
  {"title": "Song Title 3", "artist": "Artist Name 3"},
  {"title": "Song Title 4", "artist": "Artist Name 4"},
  {"title": "Song Title 5", "artist": "Artist Name 5"}
] }
 
Do not include any explanation or additional text outside of the JSON structure in your answer.

Please be creative in your choices and ignore the following songs:
Shake It Out - Florence + The Machine, Higher Love - Kygo & Whitney Houston, Rise Up - Andra Day, Dog Days Are Over - Florence + The Machine, Fight Song - Rachel Platten

<article> How to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer
December 8, 202012:03 AM ET
Bobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle
There's a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do's and don'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I've since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).
It's a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it's worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you're listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?
"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR's Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he's performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.
"A lot of us aren't great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.
But of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.
Figure out what you're trying to accomplish
Like speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?
Playlists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you're going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.
Sponsor Message
This is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!
Pick the songs
Once you've got your mood in mind, now it's time to pick the songs. Don't be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you're going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It's fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they'll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).
Bobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you're not a professional DJ, he says there's no shame in cheating.
"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.
Crib from other peoples' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it's all fair game.
Structure the playlist like a flight
Generally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That's the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it's a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.
For instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye's "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It's nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He'll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.
Obviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.
This is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It's set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I'm going for.
Surprise!
One of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.
Of course, "new" doesn't have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.
