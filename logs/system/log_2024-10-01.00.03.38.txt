The escape not only depicted the desperate lengths to which individuals might resort to regain freedom but also sparked discussions regarding necessary reforms to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

BEIRUT, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Israel's widely expected ground invasion of Lebanon appeared to be getting underway early on Tuesday as its military said troops had begun 'limited' raids against Hezbollah targets in the border area.The military said in a statement that its targets were located in villages close to the border that posed "an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel." It said the air force and artillery were supporting ground forces with "precise strikes."Local residents in the Lebanese border town of Aita al-Shaab reported heavy shelling and the sound of helicopters and drones overhead.On Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant had told local council heads in northern Israel that the next phase of the war along Lebanon's southern border would begin soon, and would support the aim of bringing home Israelis who have fled Hezbollah rockets during nearly a year of border warfare.Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah - the most powerful leader in Tehran's "Axis of Resistance" against Israeli and U.S. interests in the Middle East - was killed by Israel on Friday, dealing one of the heaviest blows in decades to both Hezbollah and its backer, Iran.It followed two weeks of intensive air strikes that have eliminated several Hezbollah commanders but also killed about 1,000 civilians and forced one million to flee their homes, according to the Lebanese government.At least 95 people were killed and 172 wounded in Israeli strikes on Lebanon's southern regions, the eastern Bekaa Valley, and Beirut in the past 24 hours, Lebanon's health ministry said early on Tuesday.Hezbollah's deputy leader Naim Qassem, in a first public speech on Monday since Nasrallah's death, said that "the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement."The Israeli attacks on militant targets in Lebanon are part of a conflict stretching from the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the occupied West Bank to Iranian-backed groups in Yemen and Iraq. The escalation has raised fears that the United States and Iran will be sucked into conflict.

This action follows Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's announcement of a new phase in the conflict aimed at safeguarding Israelis from the ongoing Hezbollah rocket attacks over the past year. The situation escalated dramatically after the reported killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, adding significant pressure on the group and its Iranian allies. Recent Israeli airstrikes have resulted in substantial casualties, claiming approximately 1,000 civilian lives and displacing a million people according to Lebanese officials. In the past day alone, Israeli strikes have reportedly killed at least 95 individuals and injured 172. Hezbollah's deputy leader Naim Qassem expressed readiness for ground engagement in response to the increased Israeli military actions. The conflict, which extends beyond Lebanon to include tensions in Gaza and Iranian-backed factions in Yemen and Iraq, raises concerns about the potential for broader U.S. and Iranian involvement. The ongoing violence reflects the complexity and volatility of the region amid a longstanding struggle for dominance among various factions."}

2024-10-01 04:01:55,793 - system - INFO - Response JSON: {'summary': "A recent study reveals that river erosion at the base of Mount Everest contributes to its upward growth. Researchers have found that as rivers carve into the mountainside, they continuously remove material from the base, which in turn allows the mountain to rise. This process occurs because the erosion reduces the weight at the mountain's base, leading the Earth's crust to rebound and push the peak higher. The study highlights the dynamic interactions between geological processes and topographical features, challenging previous beliefs that external factors such as tectonic activity were solely responsible for the mountain's elevation. The findings suggest that active geological processes like erosion play a crucial role in shaping the natural landscape. By understanding these mechanisms, scientists can better predict how mountains like Everest may continue to evolve over time. This research not only provides insights into the dynamics of one of the world's tallest peaks but also emphasizes the importance of erosion in mountain formation and growth. Overall, the study reaffirms the interconnectedness of Earth's systems, showcasing how various forces work together to influence geological phenomena."}

BEIRUT, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Hezbollah fighters are ready to confront any Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon, the group's, opens new tab deputy leader Naim Qassem said on Monday in his first public address since Israel killed its chief Hassan Nasrallah last week.Israel will not achieve its goals, he said."We will face any possibility and we are ready if the Israelis decide to enter by land and the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement," he said in an address from an undisclosed location.He was speaking as Israeli airstrikes on targets in Beirut and elsewhere in Lebanon continued, extending a two-week long wave of attacks that has eliminated several Hezbollah commanders but also killed about a 1,000 Lebanese and forced one million to flee their homes, according to the Lebanese government.The losses were Hezbollah's heaviest since Iran's Revolutionary Guards created the group in 1982 to counter an Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Nasrallah had built it up into Lebanon's most powerful military and political force, with wide sway in the Middle East.Now it faces the challenge of replacing a towering leader who was a hero to supporters because he stood up to Israel even though the West branded him a terrorist mastermind."We will choose a secretary-general for the party at the earliest opportunity...and we will fill the leadership and positions on a permanent basis," Qassem said.Qassem said Hezbollah's fighters had continued to fire rockets as deep as 150 km (93 miles) into Israeli territory and were ready to face any possible Israeli ground incursion."What we are doing is the bare minimum...We know that the battle may be long," he said. "We will win as we won in the liberation of 2006 in the face of the Israeli enemy," he added, referring to the last big conflict between the two foes.The possibility that Israel's next move might be to send ground troops and tanks over the border is on many minds and it has given no indication it will rein in the most powerful and technologically advanced military in the region.Israel says it will do what ever it takes to return its citizens to evacuated communities on its northern border safely.It has not ruled out a ground invasion and its troops have been training for it.Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said on Monday his government was ready to fully implement a U.N. resolution that had aimed to end Hezbollah's armed presence south of the Litani River as part of an agreement to stop the war with Israel.Mikati said the Lebanese army could deploy south of the river, which lies about 30 km from the country's southern border.Item 1 of 10 People inspect the damage at the site of Sunday's Israeli attack on the city of Ain Deleb, amid the ongoing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, in southern Lebanon September 30, 2024.

REUTERS/Aziz Taher Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabOTHER MILITANTS HITHours before Hezbollah's Qassem spoke, the Palestinian militant group Hamas said an Israeli airstrike killed its leader in Lebanon in the southern city of Tyre on Monday. Another Palestinian organisation said three of its leaders died in a strike in central Beirut - the first such hit inside the capital's limits.The wave of Israeli attacks on militant targets in Lebanon are part of a conflict also stretching from the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the occupied West Bank, to Yemen, and within Israel itself.Hamas said its leader in Lebanon, Fateh Sherif Abu el-Amin was killed along with his wife, son and daughter, in a strike on their house in a refugee camp in Tyre in the early hours of Monday.Another group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), said three of its leaders were killed in a strike on Beirut's Kola district.The attack against the PFLP was the first time Israel had struck Beirut beyond its southern suburbs. It hit the upper floor of an apartment building, Reuters witnesses said. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.MULTIPLE FRONTSThe latest actions indicated Israel has no intention of slowing down its offensive on multiple fronts even after eliminating Nasrallah, who was Iran's most powerful ally in its "Axis of Resistance" against Israeli and U.S. influence in the region.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said Tehran would not leave any of Israel's "criminal acts" go unanswered. He was referring to the killing of Nasrallah and an Iranian Guard deputy commander, Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan, who died in the same strikes on Friday.Russia said Nasrallah's death had led to a serious destabilisation in the broader region.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the bombing of residential areas in Lebanon had caused heavy casualties and would create a humanitarian catastrophe akin to the one in Gaza, where tens of thousands of people have died in the war between Israel and Hamas.Lebanon's Health Ministry says more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, without specifying how many were civilians. One million people - a fifth of the population - have fled their homes, the government says.The escalation has put Beirut on edge, with Lebanese fearful that Israel will expand its military campaign."There is nothing else to say or add, except God save Lebanon," Beirut resident Nawel said. "What will happen to me is the same as what can happen to anyone."

<p>A lot of threat mod­els de­scribing how AIs might es­cape our con­trol (e.g. <a href="https://aligned.substack.com/p/self-exfiltration">self-exfil­tra­tion</a>, <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/BAzCGCys4BkzGDCWR/the-prototypical-catastrophic-ai-action-is-getting-root">hack­ing the dat­a­cen­ter</a>) start out with AIs that are act­ing as agents work­ing au­tonomously on re­search tasks (es­pe­cially AI R&amp;D) in a dat­a­cen­ter con­trol­led by the AI com­pany. So I think it’s im­por­tant to have a clear pic­ture of how this kind of AI agent could work, and how it might be se­cured. I of­ten talk to peo­ple who seem to have a some­what con­fused pic­ture of how this kind of agent setup would work that causes them to con­flate some differ­ent ver­sions of the threat model, and to miss some im­por­tant points about which as­pects of the sys­tem are easy or hard to defend.</p><p>So in this post, I’ll pre­sent a sim­ple sys­tem ar­chi­tec­ture for a sys­tem where au­tonomous AIs are do­ing AI R&amp;D re­search, and then draw di­a­grams de­scribing how var­i­ous threat sce­nar­ios in­volv­ing mis­al­igned AI in­volve com­pro­mises in differ­ent places.</p><p>The main point I want to make here is that the fol­low­ing re­spon­si­bil­ities will al­most surely be hosted on log­i­cally differ­ent com­put­ers, and prob­a­bly on differ­ent phys­i­cal ma­chines:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>in­fer­ence server</strong> that serves the LLM API</p></li><li><p>The <strong>scaf­fold server</strong>, which main­tains the state of an agent loop; this is re­spon­si­ble for re­peat­edly call­ing the in­fer­ence server, pars­ing the LLM re­sponse, and ex­e­cut­ing ac­tions with the tools the agent has ac­cess to.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>ex­e­cu­tion server</strong>, on which the agent can run code and see its re­sults.</p></li></ul><p>I think that this is both:</p><ul><li><p>Pretty likely to hap­pen even if ev­ery­one in­volved is be­ing pretty care­less.

So most of the time, even though the model is writ­ing code and run­ning mod­els, it prob­a­bly won’t be di­rectly in­ter­act­ing with the code that is ei­ther run­ning its agent loop (and any of that loop’s se­cu­rity pro­vi­sions) or the code that is ac­tu­ally in­ferenc­ing the model. The model will only in­ter­face with that code by e.g. writ­ing PRs that it sub­mits and that are then de­ployed to the scaf­fold servers or in­fer­ence servers.</p><p>In some small de­ploy­ments, es­pe­cially in cases where you’re ac­tively de­vel­op­ing the scaf­fold and the ex­e­cu­tion isn’t very costly, you might have the scaf­fold on the same com­puter as the ex­e­cu­tion. For ex­am­ple, this is how I run my per­sonal AI agent—the scaf­fold runs on my lap­top, and it ex­e­cutes bash com­mands on my lap­top. But this is not very scal­able—in par­tic­u­lar, you might want to have many differ­ent com­put­ers for ex­e­cu­tion, and it’s most nat­u­ral to have a cen­tral­ized scaf­fold ser­vice that sends com­mands to many ex­e­cu­tion ma­chines.</p><p>In prac­tice I sus­pect that if your mod­els are do­ing a GPU-heavy task, a lot of the time you’ll want to have your agents sub­mit jobs to a task queue like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager">Slurm</a> in­stead of hav­ing a ded­i­cated ex­e­cu­tion ma­chine, be­cause when you have au­to­mated ML R&amp;D agents, the value of com­pute com­pared to la­bor will rise and it will be worth mak­ing your agents’ work harder to im­prove com­pute uti­liza­tion.</p><h2>An ex­tended design</h2><p class="imgonly"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/f33a545845b5b9f12bc3840d68227d4e81a093a89aa39ced8f3ac49ef8ec5494/jbkkn4m3gexclcry9not" /></p><p>I’m as­sum­ing the user is an em­ployee of the AI com­pany.</p><p>I’ve added a few items here:</p><ul><li><p>The in­ter­net.

Se­cur­ing the model’s ac­cess to model in­fer­ence is very similar to se­cur­ing a lab em­ployee’s ac­cess to model in­fer­ence: if they’re us­ing an in­ter­nal in­fer­ence API, you’re free to write any mon­i­tor­ing code you want on that API, but if they have weights ac­cess they’re by de­fault go­ing to be able to do what­ever they want.</p></li></ul></p></li></ul></p></li><li><p>In­ter­nal tools, e.g. Slack, wikis, in­ter­nal arxiv, in­ter­nal github.<ul><li><p>Like the in­ter­net, you could ei­ther ac­cess these through the scaf­fold or from the ex­e­cu­tion server.</p></li></ul></p></li></ul><h2>Differ­ent ways the AI could com­pro­mise this</h2><h3>Model weight exfiltration</h3><p>The sim­plest way to imag­ine some­thing go­ing wrong is that you gave the agent ac­cess to sen­si­tive model weights on the ex­e­cu­tion server, and it just copies them to a re­mote server on the in­ter­net.</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9fbb6d9ad39411a70b5fbf106d21ffea5ad31ff15407d54778117c064c77f61b/gi3v2ilhrxrdr0b4idyg" /></p><p>Note that it’s pretty hard to imag­ine this hap­pen­ing straight­for­wardly, for a host of rea­sons:</p><ul><li><p>Even if you choose to give the agent in­ter­net ac­cess from its ex­e­cu­tion server, it’s hard to see why it needs to have enough egress band­width to get the weights out. <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/rf66R4YsrCHgWx9RG/preventing-exfiltration-via-upload-limits-seems-promising">See here for more dis­cus­sion of up­load limits for pre­vent­ing weight exfil­tra­tion</a>.</p></li><li><p>Even if it could exfil­trate the weights, it might be a bit tricky for it to find a server to copy the weights to. Like, if I wanted to send some­one a gi­ant file from my com­puter right now, I don’t ac­tu­ally have any servers in the out­side world that I can im­me­di­ately ac­cess.</p></li></ul><p>Another strat­egy the model could use is to is­sue com­mands that hack an in­fer­ence server and cause it to exfil­trate the weights:</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7dad4cd94efb84d73d6e18524beb457b76fa4c6d6b2355ee8e2ba07e70b10a49/vdqkdulrinuuieuzpwcu" /></p><p>For ex­am­ple, this might be what hap­pens if you fail to prop­erly se­cure out­go­ing net­work con­nec­tions from the ex­e­cu­tion server and in­com­ing net­work con­nec­tions to the in­fer­ence server. It should be pretty sim­ple to pre­vent this.</p><p>Another strat­egy would be to com­mit code that com­pro­mises one of those other servers and causes them to exfil­trate the model weights. In the ar­chi­tec­ture we’ve dis­cussed, the in­fer­ence server is a par­tic­u­larly nat­u­ral tar­get of at­tack, be­cause it definitely has the model weights:</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4e0f909d8858f0311ffe23c7959afa39d56be6c36509e44a9e1471f580714450/pt61ujew3nn4gd8rdtpj" /></p><p>Though this par­tic­u­lar story for weight exfil­tra­tion also seems pretty easy to pre­vent with stan­dard com­puter se­cu­rity: there’s no rea­son for the in­fer­ence servers to have the per­mis­sion to cre­ate out­go­ing net­work con­nec­tions. But it could also write code such that the weights are trans­ferred to the scaf­fold, which in turn could trans­fer them to the in­ter­net. In gen­eral, mod­ify­ing the code­base or the in­fras­truc­ture is prob­a­bly the best self-exfil­tra­tion strat­egy that doesn’t re­quire help from em­ploy­ees (in sce­nar­ios where AIs are mas­sively de­ployed in­ter­nally and are do­ing most of the work in­side an AI lab).</p><h3>Rogue in­ter­nal deployments</h3><p>In <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/ceBpLHJDdCt3xfEok/ai-catastrophes-and-rogue-deployments">AI catas­tro­phes and rogue de­ploy­ments</a>, I de­scribed the pos­si­bil­ity of the model spawn­ing an unau­tho­rized agent that doesn’t have your in­tended safety mea­sures built in to it. Now that we have this sys­tem ar­chi­tec­ture, we can de­scribe some spe­cific ver­sions of that threat model.</p><p>The eas­iest way to imag­ine a rogue in­ter­nal de­ploy­ment is the model writ­ing its own agent loop on the ex­e­cu­tion ma­chine, us­ing its GPUs.</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/53b2d2c8d97c28f43475575bf601926c27c16f38496ed12b85ac3392a9050d2f/kurq3gdnqcdjia5b0lcn" /></p><p>Another op­tion would be for it to make a rogue scaf­fold on the ex­e­cu­tion ma­chine that uses its ac­cess to the in­fer­ence server:</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8160ac729d4f423c76576aa4a760a1dbf794406a89860510c13a065e173b312f/dxysr316wukshlyxlzc7" /></p><p>But this seems eas­ier to pre­vent, be­cause it’s easy to add ba­sic mon­i­tor­ing to the in­fer­ence server that should catch queries that are blatantly be­ing used to im­ple­ment unau­tho­rized scaf­folds.</p><p>You could also have a rogue in­ter­nal de­ploy­ment via com­pro­mis­ing one of the other ser­vices, e.g. this story where you com­pro­mise the in­ter­nal de­ploy­ment.</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/847b959cd3f4af46e797be066e72286225e1e624517f42e400e15d931bc1a6cd/skmksw3kchiqx5uwydy0" /></p><h2>Us­ing this frame­work to dis­cuss alleged ex­am­ples of AIs mod­ify­ing their own environments</h2><h3>Sakana AI</h3><p>Sakana AI got some hype when they re­ported their AI sci­en­tist edit­ing its own code to run with a longer time­out. They ac­tu­ally did just have their sci­en­tist ex­e­cut­ing code di­rectly on the ma­chine that was run­ning their scaf­fold, de­spite en­courag­ing other peo­ple to use con­tainer­iza­tion. I think this is bizarre. They de­scribe this choice caus­ing prob­lems for them, e.g. their agent spawned too many pro­cesses at one point, and at an­other it used too much disk space and crashed their com­puter.</p><h3>o1 agent architecture</h3><p>OpenAI de­scribes an agent ar­chi­tec­ture like so (this is from <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-system-card/">the o1 sys­tem card</a>):</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/c27f26ab8770e4278495077370dd2feda3952c85f7166476ef2103bfa57384c5/rkaysklnfggqr0y4fbi5" /></p><p>Where they wrote “Agent” here, I’m draw­ing out the dis­tinc­tion be­tween the scaf­fold and the in­fer­ence server, which al­most surely ex­isted here.
