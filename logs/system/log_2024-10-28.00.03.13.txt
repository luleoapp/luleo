His controversial decisions, which sparked internal dissent and criticism, ultimately led to a decrease in public support and weakened his government's stability. Ishiba's strategies, intended to foster unity and rally support within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, instead exposed deep fractures both within his party and among the electorate. As discontent among party members grew, calls for leadership changes emerged, highlighting the challenges Ishiba faced in maintaining control. Furthermore, opposition parties seized the opportunity to capitalize on his struggles, amplifying their voices and gaining traction among the public. The fallout from this political miscalculation not only diminished Ishiba's authority but also put into question the future direction of the government. In a politically fragile environment, analysts emphasize the importance of restoring trust and cohesion within the ruling party as essential steps for Ishiba to recover. The situation exemplifies the unpredictable nature of political landscapes, where bold moves can lead to unforeseen consequences, reshaping the dynamics of power in Japanese politics."}

Proponents argue that imposing tariffs could bolster national security and economic independence by reducing reliance on overseas goods.

<p>Over the last few months, ARC has re­leased a num­ber of pieces of re­search. While some of these can be in­de­pen­dently mo­ti­vated, there is also a more unified re­search vi­sion be­hind them.

<p>At the most zoomed-out level, ARC is work­ing on the prob­lem of “<a href="https://ai-alignment.com/clarifying-ai-alignment-cec47cd69dd6">in­tent al­ign­ment</a>”: how to de­sign AI sys­tems that are try­ing to do what their op­er­a­tors want. While many prac­ti­tion­ers are tak­ing an iter­a­tive ap­proach to this prob­lem, there are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15217">fore­see­able ways</a> in which to­day’s lead­ing ap­proaches could fail to scale to more in­tel­li­gent AI sys­tems, which could have <a href="https://www.cold-takes.com/without-specific-countermeasures-the-easiest-path-to-transformative-ai-likely-leads-to-ai-takeover/">un­de­sir­able con­se­quences</a>. ARC is at­tempt­ing to de­velop al­gorithms that have a bet­ter chance of scal­ing grace­fully to fu­ture AI sys­tems, hence the term “<strong>scal­able al­ign­ment</strong>”.</p>
<p>ARC’s par­tic­u­lar ap­proach to scal­able al­ign­ment is a “builder-breaker” method­ol­ogy (de­scribed in more de­tail <a href="https://ai-alignment.com/my-research-methodology-b94f2751cb2c">here</a>, and ex­em­plified in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit">ELK re­port</a>). Roughly speak­ing, if the scal­a­bil­ity of an al­gorithm de­pends on un­known em­piri­cal con­tin­gen­cies (such as how ad­vanced AI sys­tems gen­er­al­ize), then we try to make worst-case as­sump­tions in­stead of at­tempt­ing to ex­trap­o­late from to­day’s sys­tems. This is in­tended to cre­ate a fea­si­ble iter­a­tion loop for the­o­ret­i­cal re­search. We are also con­duct­ing em­piri­cal re­search, but mostly to help gen­er­ate and probe the­o­ret­i­cal ideas rather than to test differ­ent em­piri­cal as­sump­tions.</p>

<p>Most of ARC’s re­search at­tempts to solve one of two cen­tral sub­prob­lems in al­ign­ment: al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness and elic­it­ing la­tent knowl­edge (ELK).</p>
<p><strong>Align­ment ro­bust­ness</strong> refers to AI sys­tems re­main­ing in­tent al­igned even when faced with out-of-dis­tri­bu­tion in­puts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> There are a few rea­sons to fo­cus on failures of al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness, as dis­cussed <a href="https://ai-alignment.com/techniques-for-optimizing-worst-case-performance-39eafec74b99">here</a> (where they are called “ma­lign” failures). A quintessen­tial ex­am­ple of an al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness failure is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820"><em>de­cep­tive al­ign­ment</em></a>, also known as “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08379">schem­ing</a>”: the pos­si­bil­ity that an AI sys­tem will in­ter­nally rea­son about the ob­jec­tive that it is be­ing trained on, and stop be­ing in­tent al­igned when it de­tects clues that it has been taken out of its train­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
<p><strong>Elic­it­ing la­tent knowl­edge (ELK)</strong> is defined in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit">this re­port</a>, and asks: how can we train an AI sys­tem to hon­estly re­port its in­ter­nal be­liefs, rather than what it pre­dicts a hu­man would think? If we could do this, then we could po­ten­tially avoid mis­al­ign­ment by check­ing whether the model’s be­liefs are con­sis­tent with its ac­tions be­ing helpful. ELK could help with scal­able al­ign­ment via al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness, but it could also help via <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/SzecSPYxqRa5GCaSF/clarifying-inner-alignment-terminology">outer al­ign­ment</a>, by giv­ing the re­ward func­tion ac­cess to rele­vant in­for­ma­tion known by the model.</p>
<h3 id="zoom-level-3">Zoom level 3</h3>
<p class="imgonly"><img alt="birds_eye_lvl3.svg" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztokaf9harKTmRcn4/fyvd4wrd3eb8jzkmoowt" /></p>
<p>ARC hopes to make progress on both al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness and ELK us­ing <strong>heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions</strong> for neu­ral net­work be­hav­iors. A heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tion is similar to the kind of ex­pla­na­tion found in <a href="https://www.transformer-circuits.pub/2022/mech-interp-essay">mechanis­tic in­ter­pretabil­ity</a>, ex­cept that ARC is at­tempt­ing to find a math­e­mat­i­cal no­tion of an “ex­pla­na­tion”, so that they can be found and used au­to­mat­i­cally. This is similar to how for­mal ver­ifi­ca­tion for or­di­nary pro­grams can be performed au­to­mat­i­cally, ex­cept that we be­lieve proof is too strict of a stan­dard to be fea­si­ble. Th­ese similar­i­ties are dis­cussed in more de­tail in the post <a href="https://www.alignment.org/blog/formal-verification-heuristic-explanations-and-surprise-accounting/">For­mal ver­ifi­ca­tion, heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions and sur­prise ac­count­ing</a> (es­pe­cially the first cou­ple of sec­tions, up un­til “Sur­prise ac­count­ing”).</p>
<p>A heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tion for a rare but high-stakes kind of failure could help with al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness, while a heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tion for a spe­cific be­hav­ior of in­ter­est could help with ELK. Th­ese two ap­pli­ca­tions of heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions are fleshed out in more de­tail at the next zoom level.</p>

<p>ARC has iden­ti­fied two broad ways in heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions could help with al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness and/​or ELK.</p>
<p><strong>Low prob­a­bil­ity es­ti­ma­tion (LPE)</strong> is the task of es­ti­mat­ing the prob­a­bil­ity of a rare kind of model out­put. The most ob­vi­ous ap­proach to LPE is to try to find model in­puts that give rise to such an out­put, but this can be in­fea­si­ble (e.g. if the model were to im­ple­ment some­thing like a cryp­to­graphic hash func­tion). In­stead, we can “<a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/9Dy5YRaoCxH9zuJqa/relaxed-adversarial-training-for-inner-alignment">re­lax</a>” this goal and search for a heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tion of why the model could hy­po­thet­i­cally pro­duce such an out­put (e.g. by treat­ing the out­put of the cryp­to­graphic hash func­tion as ran­dom). LPE would help with al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness by al­low­ing us to se­lect mod­els for which we can­not ex­plain why they would ever be­have catas­troph­i­cally, even hy­po­thet­i­cally. This mo­ti­va­tion for LPE is dis­cussed in much greater depth in the post <a href="https://www.alignment.org/blog/estimating-tail-risk-in-neural-networks/">Es­ti­mat­ing Tail Risk in Neu­ral Net­works</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanism dis­tinc­tion</strong> de­scribes our broad hope for how heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions could help with ELK. A cen­tral challenge for ELK is “sen­sor tam­per­ing”: de­tect­ing when the model re­ports what it pre­dicts a hu­man would think, but the hu­man has been fooled in some way. Our hope is to de­tect this by notic­ing that the model’s re­port has been pro­duced by an “ab­nor­mal mechanism”. There are a few po­ten­tial ways in which heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions could be used to perform mechanism dis­tinc­tion, but the one we cur­rently con­sider the most promis­ing is <strong>mechanis­tic anomaly de­tec­tion (MAD)</strong>, as ex­plained in the post <a href="https://www.alignment.org/blog/mechanistic-anomaly-detection-and-elk/">Mechanis­tic anomaly de­tec­tion and ELK</a> (for a gen­tler in­tro­duc­tion to MAD, see <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/n7DFwtJvCzkuKmtbG/a-gentle-introduction-to-mechanistic-anomaly-detection">this post</a>). A var­i­ant of MAD is <strong>safe dis­til­la­tion</strong>, which is an al­ter­na­tive way to perform mechanism dis­tinc­tion if we also have ac­cess to a for­mal speci­fi­ca­tion of what we are try­ing to elicit la­tent knowl­edge of.</p>
<p>A semi-for­mal ac­count of how heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions could en­able all of LPE, MAD and safe dis­til­la­tion is given in <a href="https://www.alignment.org/blog/research-update-towards-a-law-of-iterated-expectations-for-heuristic-estimators/">Towards a Law of Iter­ated Ex­pec­ta­tions for Heuris­tic Es­ti­ma­tors</a>.

<h2 id="further-subproblems">Fur­ther subproblems</h2>
<p>ARC’s re­search can be sub­di­vided fur­ther, and we have been putting sig­nifi­cant effort into a num­ber of sub­prob­lems not ex­plic­itly men­tioned above. For in­stance, our work on heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions in­cludes both work on <strong>for­mal­iz­ing heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions</strong> (de­vis­ing a for­mal frame­work for heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions) and work on <strong>find­ing heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions</strong> (de­sign­ing effi­cient search al­gorithms for them). Some sub­prob­lems of these in­clude:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Mea­sur­ing qual­ity</strong>: “<a href="https://www.alignment.org/blog/formal-verification-heuristic-explanations-and-surprise-accounting/#surprise-accounting">sur­prise ac­count­ing</a>” offers a po­ten­tial way to mea­sure the qual­ity of a heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tion, which is im­por­tant for be­ing able to search for high-qual­ity ex­pla­na­tions. How­ever, it is cur­rently an in­for­mal frame­work with many miss­ing de­tails.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ca­pac­ity al­lo­ca­tion</strong>: it will prob­a­bly be too challeng­ing to find high-qual­ity ex­pla­na­tions for ev­ery as­pect of a model’s be­hav­ior. In­stead, we can try to tai­lor ex­pla­na­tions to­wards be­hav­iors with po­ten­tially catas­trophic con­se­quences. A good loss func­tion for heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions should push for qual­ity only where it is rele­vant to the be­hav­ior at hand.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cherry-pick­ing</strong>: if we use a heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tion to es­ti­mate some­thing (as in low prob­a­bil­ity es­ti­ma­tion), we need to make sure that the way in which we find the ex­pla­na­tion doesn’t sys­tem­at­i­cally bias the es­ti­mate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Form of rep­re­sen­ta­tion</strong>: one form that a heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tion could take is of an “<a href="https://www.alignment.org/blog/estimating-tail-risk-in-neural-networks/#layer-by-layer-activation-modeling">ac­ti­va­tion model</a>”, i.e. a prob­a­bil­ity dis­tri­bu­tion over a model’s in­ter­nal ac­ti­va­tions. How­ever, we may also need to rep­re­sent ex­pla­na­tions that do not cor­re­spond to any par­tic­u­lar prob­a­bil­ity dis­tri­bu­tion.</p></li><li><p><strong>For­mal desider­ata</strong>: we can at­tempt to for­mal­ize heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions by con­sid­er­ing <a href="https://www.alignment.org/blog/research-update-towards-a-law-of-iterated-expectations-for-heuristic-estimators/">prop­er­ties</a> that we think they should satisfy, and see­ing if those prop­er­ties can be satis­fied.</p></li><li><p><strong>No-co­in­ci­dence prin­ci­ple</strong>: in or­der for heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions to work in the worst case, we need ev­ery pos­si­ble be­hav­ior to be amenable to ex­pla­na­tion. We some­times re­fer to this desider­a­tum as the “no-co­in­ci­dence prin­ci­ple” (a term taken from <a href="https://mxphi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/MxPhi-Gowers2023.pdf">this pa­per</a>). Coun­terex­am­ples to this prin­ci­ple could pre­sent ob­sta­cles to our ap­proach.</p></li><li><p><strong>Em­piri­cal reg­u­lar­i­ties</strong>: some model weights may have no ex­pla­na­tion be­yond be­ing tuned to match some em­piri­cal av­er­age, ei­ther be­cause the in­put dis­tri­bu­tion is defined em­piri­cally, or be­cause of an emer­gent reg­u­lar­ity in a for­mally-defined sys­tem (such as the rel­a­tive value of a queen and a pawn in chess). A good no­tion of heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions should be able to deal with these.</p></li></ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have painted a high-level pic­ture of ARC’s re­search, ex­plained how our pub­lished re­search fits into it, and briefly dis­cussed some ad­di­tional sub­prob­lems that we are work­ing on. We hope this pro­vides peo­ple with a clearer sense of what we are up to.</p>

2024-10-28 04:02:53,498 - system - INFO - Response JSON: {'summary': "The article provides an overview of the research vision of ARC (AI Alignment Research Center) and its recent publications. Central to their research is the problem of 'intent alignment,' which focuses on designing AI systems that align with human operators' intentions, especially as systems become more intelligent. ARC advocates for a 'scalable alignment' approach through a 'builder-breaker' methodology, which emphasizes understanding worst-case scenarios rather than extrapolating from current systems. Key sub-problems in their focus include alignment robustness—ensuring AI remains aligned in unforeseen situations—and eliciting latent knowledge (ELK), which aims to make AI systems transparently communicate their internal beliefs. The research explores heuristic explanations to identify and mitigate potential alignment failures and involves methods like low probability estimation (LPE) and mechanistic anomaly detection (MAD). ARC’s ongoing studies also address issues like the quality of heuristic explanations and capacity allocation. By systematically exploring these dimensions, ARC aims to enhance our understanding of how AI systems can be made more reliable and aligned with human values, contributing to safer and more effective AI development."}
