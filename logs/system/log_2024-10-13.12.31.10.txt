<p>How can we make many hu­mans who are very good at solv­ing difficult prob­lems?</p>
<h1>Sum­mary (table of made-up num­bers)</h1>
<p>I made up the made-up num­bers in this table of made-up num­bers; there­fore, the num­bers in this table of made-up num­bers are made-up num­bers.</p>
<p class="imgonly"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/jTiSWHKAtnyA723LE/cddsgto9wpcxkfgz9mxv" /></p>

<h1>Call to action</h1>
<p>If you have a shit­load of money, there are some pro­jects you can give money to that would make su­per­ge­nius hu­mans on de­mand hap­pen faster. If you have a fuck­ton of money, there are pro­jects whose cre­ation you could fund that would greatly ac­cel­er­ate this tech­nol­ogy.</p>
<p>If you’re young and smart, or are already an ex­pert in ei­ther stem cell /​ re­pro­duc­tive biol­ogy, biotech, or any­thing re­lated to brain-com­puter in­ter­faces, there are some pro­jects you could work on.</p>
<p>If nei­ther, think hard, maybe I missed some­thing.</p>
<p>You can DM me or gmail me at tsvibt­con­tact.</p>
<h1>Context</h1>
<h2>The goal</h2>
<p>What em­pow­ers hu­man­ity is the abil­ity of hu­mans to no­tice, rec­og­nize, re­mem­ber, cor­re­late, ideate, tin­ker, ex­plain, test, judge, com­mu­ni­cate, in­ter­ro­gate, and de­sign. To in­crease hu­man em­pow­er­ment, im­prove those abil­ities by im­prov­ing their source: hu­man brains.</p>
<p>AGI is go­ing to de­stroy the fu­ture’s promise of mas­sive hu­mane value. To pre­vent that, cre­ate hu­mans who can nav­i­gate the cre­ation of AGI. Hu­mans al­ive now can’t figure out how to make AGI that leads to a hu­mane uni­verse.</p>
<p>Th­ese are de­sir­able virtues: philo­soph­i­cal prob­lem-solv­ing abil­ity, cre­ativity, wis­dom, taste, mem­ory, speed, clev­er­ness, un­der­stand­ing, judge­ment. Th­ese virtues de­pend on men­tal and so­cial soft­ware, but can also be en­hanced by en­hanc­ing hu­man brains.</p>
<p>How much? To nav­i­gate the cre­ation of AGI will likely re­quire solv­ing philo­soph­i­cal prob­lems that are be­yond the ca­pa­bil­ities of the cur­rent pop­u­la­tion of hu­mans, given the available time (some decades). Six stan­dard de­vi­a­tions is 1 in 10^9, seven stan­dard de­vi­a­tions is 1 in 10^12. So the goal is to cre­ate many peo­ple who are 7 SDs above the mean in cog­ni­tive ca­pa­bil­ities. That’s “strong hu­man in­tel­li­gence am­plifi­ca­tion”. (Why not more SDs? There are <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/08/downside-risks-of-genomic-selection.html">many down­side risks</a> to chang­ing the pro­cess that cre­ates hu­mans, so go­ing fur­ther is an un­nec­es­sary risk.)</p>
<p>It is my con­vic­tion that this is the only way for­ward for hu­man­ity.</p>
<h2>Con­straint: Alger­non’s law</h2>
<p><a href="https://gwern.net/drug-heuristic">Alger­non’s law</a>: If there’s a change to hu­man brains that hu­man-evolu­tion could have made, but didn’t, then it is net-neu­tral or net-nega­tive for in­clu­sive rel­a­tive ge­netic fit­ness. If in­tel­li­gence is ce­teris paribus a fit­ness ad­van­tage, then a change to hu­man brains that in­creases in­tel­li­gence must ei­ther come with other dis­ad­van­tages or else be in­ac­cessible to evolu­tion.</p>
<p>Ways around Alger­non’s law, in­creas­ing in­tel­li­gence any­way:</p>
<ul><li><p>We could ap­ply a stronger se­lec­tion pres­sure than hu­man-evolu­tion ap­plied. The se­lec­tion pres­sure that hu­man-evolu­tion ap­plied to hu­mans is capped (some­how) by the vari­a­tion of IGF among all germline cells. So it can only push down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_load">mu­ta­tional load</a> to some point.</p></li><li><p>Maybe (re­cent, per­haps) hu­man-evolu­tion se­lected against in­tel­li­gence be­yond some point.</p></li><li><p>We could come up with bet­ter de­sign ideas for mind-hard­ware.</p></li><li><p>We could use re­sources that evolu­tion didn’t have. We have metal, wires, ra­dios, ba­si­cally un­limited elec­tric and metabolic power, re­li­able high-qual­ity nu­tri­tion, me­chan­i­cal cool­ing de­vices, etc.</p></li><li><p>Given our re­sources, some prop­er­ties that would have been dis­ad­van­tages are no longer ma­jor dis­ad­van­tages. E.g. a higher metabolic cost is barely a mean­ingful cost.</p></li><li><p>We have differ­ent val­ues from evolu­tion; we might want to trade away IGF to gain in­tel­li­gence.</p></li></ul>
<h2>How to know what makes a smart brain</h2>
<h3>Figure it out ourselves</h3>
<ul><li><p>We can test in­ter­ven­tions and see what works.</p></li><li><p>We can think about what, me­chan­i­cally, the brain needs in or­der to func­tion well.</p></li><li><p>We can think about think­ing and then think of ways to think bet­ter.</p></li></ul>
<h3>Copy na­ture’s work</h3>
<ul><li><p>There are seven billion nat­u­ral ex­per­i­ments, juz run­nin aroun doin stuff. We can ob­serve the be­hav­iors of the hu­mans and learn what cir­cum­stances of their cre­ation leads to fewer or more cog­ni­tive ca­pa­bil­ities.</p></li><li><p>We can see what hu­man-evolu­tion in­vested in, aimed at cog­ni­tive ca­pa­bil­ities, and add more of that.</p></li></ul>
<h1>Brain emulation</h1>
<h2>The approach</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: figure out how neu­rons work, scan hu­man brains, make a simu­la­tion of a scanned brain, and then use soft­ware im­prove­ments to make the brain think bet­ter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is to have a hu­man brain, but with the ad­van­tages of be­ing in a com­puter: faster pro­cess­ing, more scal­able hard­ware, more in­tro­spectable (e.g. read ac­cess to all in­ter­nals, even if they are ob­scured; com­pu­ta­tion traces), re­pro­ducible com­pu­ta­tions, A/​B test­ing com­po­nents or other tweaks, low-level op­ti­miz­able, pro­cess fork­ing. This is a “figure it out our­selves” method——we’d have to figure out what makes the em­u­lated brain smarter.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>While we have some han­dle on the fast (&lt;1 sec­ond) pro­cesses that hap­pen in a neu­ron, no one knows much about the slow (&gt;5 sec­ond) pro­cesses. The slow pro­cesses are nec­es­sary for what we care about in think­ing. Peo­ple work­ing on brain em­u­la­tion mostly aren’t work­ing on this prob­lem be­cause they have enough prob­lems as it is.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ex­per­i­ments here, the sort that would give 0-to-1 end-to-end feed­back about whether the whole thing is work­ing, would be ex­tremely ex­pen­sive; and unit tests are much harder to cal­ibrate (what refer­ence to use?).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Par­tial suc­cess could con­sti­tute a ma­jor AGI ad­vance, which would be ex­tremely dan­ger­ous. Un­like most of the other ap­proaches listed here, brain em­u­la­tions wouldn’t be hard­ware-bound (skull-size bound).</p>
</li><li>
<p>The po­ten­tial for value drift——mak­ing a hu­man-like mind with al­tered /​ dis­torted /​ alien val­ues——is much higher here than with the other ap­proaches. This might be es­pe­cially se­lected for: sub­cor­ti­cal brain struc­tures, which are es­pe­cially value-laden, are more phys­iolog­i­cally het­ero­ge­neous than cor­ti­cal struc­tures, and there­fore would re­quire sub­stan­tially more sci­en­tific work to model ac­cu­rately. Fur­ther: be­cause the em­u­la­tion ap­proach is based on copy­ing as much as pos­si­ble and then filling in de­tails by see­ing what works, many de­tails will be filled in by non-hu­mane pro­cesses (such as the shap­ing pro­cesses in nor­mal hu­man child­hood).</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Fun­da­men­tally, brain em­u­la­tions are a 0-to-1 move, whereas the other ap­proaches take a nor­mal hu­man brain as the ba­sic en­g­ine and then mod­ify it in some way. The 0-to-1 ap­proach is more difficult, more spec­u­la­tive, and riskier.</p>
<h1>Ge­nomic approaches</h1>
<p>Th­ese ap­proaches look at the 7 billion nat­u­ral ex­per­i­ments and see which ge­netic var­i­ants cor­re­late with in­tel­li­gence. IQ is a very im­perfect but mea­surable and suffi­cient proxy for prob­lem-solv­ing abil­ity. Since &gt;7 of ev­ery 10 IQ points are ex­plained by ge­netic vari­a­tion, we can ex­tract a lot of what na­ture knows about what makes brains have many ca­pa­bil­ities. We can’t get that knowl­edge about ca­pa­ble brains in a form us­able as en­g­ineer­ing (to build a brain from scratch), but we can at least get it in a form us­able as scores (which genomes make brains with fewer or more ca­pa­bil­ities). Th­ese are “copy na­ture’s work” ap­proaches.</p>
<h2>Adult brain gene editing</h2>
<h3>The approach</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: edit IQ-pos­i­tive var­i­ants into the brain cells of adult hu­mans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See “<a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/JEhW3HDMKzekDShva/significantly-enhancing-adult-intelligence-with-gene-editing">Sig­nifi­cantly En­hanc­ing …</a>”.</p>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>De­liv­ery is difficult.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Edi­tors dam­age DNA.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The effect is greatly at­ten­u­ated, com­pared to germline ge­net­ics. In adult­hood, learn­ing win­dows have been passed by; many genes are no longer ac­tive; dam­age that ac­cu­mu­lates has already been ac­cu­mu­lated; many cells don’t re­ceive the ed­its. This adds up to an op­ti­mistic ceiling some­where around +2 or +3 SDs.</p>
</li></ul>
<h2>Germline engineering</h2>
<p>This is the way that will work. (Note that there are <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/08/downside-risks-of-genomic-selection.html">many down­side risks to germline en­g­ineer­ing</a>, though AFAICT they can be alle­vi­ated to such an ex­tent that the trade­off is worth it by far.)</p>
<h3>The approach</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: make a baby from a cell that has a genome that has many IQ-pos­i­tive ge­netic var­i­ants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sub­tasks:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><em>Know what genome would pro­duce ge­niuses.</em> This is already solved well enough. Be­cause there are already poly­genic scores for IQ that ex­plain &gt;12% of the ob­served var­i­ance in IQ (<a href="http://pgscatalog.org/score/PGS003724/">pgscat­a­log.org/​score/​PGS003724/​</a>), 10 SDs of raw se­lec­tion power would trans­late into trait se­lec­tion power at a rate greater than √(1/​9) = <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub></span>, giv­ing &gt;3.3 SDs of IQ trait se­lec­tion power, i.e. +50 IQ points.</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Make a cell with such a genome.</em> This is prob­a­bly not that hard——via CRISPR edit­ing stem cells, via <a href="https://denovo.substack.com/p/meiosis-is-all-you-need">iter­ated meiotic se­lec­tion</a>, or via chro­mo­some se­lec­tion. My <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/08/the-power-of-selection.html#3-selecting-all-of-many-components">math</a> and simu­la­tions show that sev­eral meth­ods would achieve strong in­tel­li­gence am­plifi­ca­tion. If in­duced meio­sis into cul­turable cells is de­vel­oped, IMS can provide &gt;10 SDs of raw se­lec­tion power given very roughly $10^5 and a few months.</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Know what epige­nomic state (in sperm /​ egg /​ zy­gote) leads to healthy de­vel­op­ment.</em> This is not fully un­der­stood——it’s an open prob­lem that can be worked on.</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Given a cell, make a de­rived cell (diploid mi­totic or hap­loid meiotic offspring cell) with that epige­nomic state.</em> This is not fully un­der­stood——it’s an open prob­lem that can be worked on. This is the main bot­tle­neck.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Th­ese tasks don’t nec­es­sar­ily com­pletely fac­tor out. For ex­am­ple, some ap­proaches might try to “pig­gy­back” off the nat­u­ral epige­nomic re­set by us­ing chro­mo­somes from nat­u­ral ga­metes or zy­gotes, which will have the cor­rect epige­nomic state already.</p>
<p>See also Bran­wen, “<a href="https://gwern.net/embryo-selection">Em­bryo Selec­tion …</a>”.</p>
<p>More in­for­ma­tion on re­quest. Some of the im­por­tant re­search is hap­pen­ing, but there’s always room for more fund­ing and tal­ent.</p>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>It takes a long time; the baby has to grow up. (But <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2023/07/views-on-when-agi-comes-and-on-strategy.html">we prob­a­bly have time</a>, and de­lay­ing AGI only helps if you have an out.)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Cor­rect­ing the epige­nomic state of a cell to be de­vel­op­men­tally com­pe­tent is un­solved.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The baby can’t con­sent, un­like with other ap­proaches, which work with adults. (But the baby can also be made ge­nom­i­cally dis­posed to be ex­cep­tion­ally healthy and sane.)</p>
</li><li>
<p>It’s the most poli­ti­cally con­tentious ap­proach.</p>
</li></ul>
<h1>Sig­nal­ing molecules for cre­ative brains</h1>
<h2>The approach</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: iden­tify mas­ter sig­nal­ing molecules that con­trol brain ar­eas or brain de­vel­op­men­tal stages that are as­so­ci­ated with prob­lem-solv­ing abil­ity; treat adult brains with those sig­nal­ing molecules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to evolved mod­u­lar­ity, or­ganic sys­tems are gov­erned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_regulatory_network">ge­nomic reg­u­la­tory net­works</a>. Maybe we can iso­late and ar­tifi­cially ac­ti­vate GRNs that gen­er­ate phys­iolog­i­cal states that pro­duce cog­ni­tive ca­pa­bil­ities not oth­er­wise available in a de­fault adult’s brain. The hope is that there’s a very small set of mas­ter reg­u­la­tors that can turn on larger cir­cuits with strong or­ches­trated effects, as is the case with hor­mones, so that treat­ments are rel­a­tively sim­ple, high-lev­er­age, and dis­cov­er­able. For ex­am­ple, maybe we could repli­cate the sig­nal­ing con­text that ac­ti­vates childish learn­ing ca­pa­bil­ities, or maybe we could repli­cate the sig­nal­ing con­text that ac­ti­vates pari­etal prob­lem-solv­ing in more brain tis­sue.</p>
<p>I haven’t looked into this enough to know whether or not it makes sense. This is a “copy na­ture’s work” ap­proach: na­ture knows more about how to make brains that are good at think­ing, than what is ex­pressed in a nor­mal adult hu­man.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Who knows what nega­tive effects might re­sult.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Learn­ing win­dows might be ir­re­versibly lost af­ter child­hood, e.g. by long-range con­nec­tions be­ing ir­recov­er­ably pruned.</p>
</li></ul>
<h1>Brain-brain elec­tri­cal in­ter­face approaches</h1>
<p>Brain-com­puter in­ter­faces don’t ob­vi­ously give an op­por­tu­nity for large in­creases in cre­ative philo­soph­i­cal prob­lem-solv­ing abil­ity. See the dis­cus­sion in “<a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/11/prosthetic-connectivity.html">Pros­thetic con­nec­tivity</a>”. The fun­da­men­tal prob­lem is that we, pro­gram­ming the com­puter part, don’t know how to write code that does trans­for­ma­tions that will be use­ful for neu­ral minds.</p>
<p>But brain-brain in­ter­faces——adding con­nec­tions be­tween brain tis­sues that nor­mally aren’t con­nected——might in­crease those abil­ities. Th­ese ap­proaches use elec­trodes to read elec­tri­cal sig­nals from neu­rons, then trans­mit those sig­nals (per­haps com­pressed/​filtered/​trans­formed) through wires /​ fiber op­tic ca­bles /​ EM waves, then write them to other neu­rons through other elec­trodes. Th­ese are “copy na­ture’s work” ap­proaches, in the sense that we think na­ture made neu­rons that know how to ar­range them­selves use­fully when con­nected with other neu­rons.</p>
<h2>Prob­lems with all elec­tri­cal brain in­ter­face approaches</h2>
<ul><li><p><em>The butcher num­ber.</em> Cur­rent elec­trodes kill more neu­rons than they record. That doesn’t scale safely to mil­lions of con­nec­tions.</p></li><li><p><em>Bad feed­back.</em> Neu­ral synapses are not strictly feed­for­ward; there is of­ten re­cip­ro­cal sig­nal­ing and reg­u­la­tion. Elec­trodes wouldn’t com­mu­ni­cate that sort of feed­back, which might be im­por­tant for learn­ing.</p></li></ul>
<h2>Mas­sive cere­bral pros­thetic connectivity</h2>
<p class="imgonly"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/jTiSWHKAtnyA723LE/tip85f1cbyiqytbckaoy" /></p>
<p>Source: <a class="bare-url" href="https://www.neuromedia.ca/white-matter/">https://​​www.neu­ro­me­dia.ca/​​white-mat­ter/​​</a></p>
<p>Half of the hu­man brain is white mat­ter, i.e. neu­ronal ax­ons with fatty sheaths around them to make them trans­mit sig­nals faster. White mat­ter is ~1/​10 the vol­ume of ro­dent brains, but ~1/​2 the vol­ume of hu­man brains. Wiring is ex­pen­sive and gets min­i­mized; see “Prin­ci­ples of Neu­ral De­sign” by Ster­ling and Laugh­lin. All these long-range ax­ons are a huge metabolic ex­pense. That means fast, long-range, high band­width (so to speak——there are many differ­ent points in­volved) com­mu­ni­ca­tion is im­por­tant to cog­ni­tive ca­pa­bil­ities. See <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/white-matter">here</a>.</p>
<p>A bet­ter-re­searched com­par­i­son would be helpful. But vaguely, my guess is that if we com­pare long-range neu­ronal ax­ons to metal wires, fiber op­tic ca­bles, or EM trans­mis­sions, we’d see (amor­tized over mil­lions of con­nec­tions): ax­ons are in the same bal­l­park in terms of en­ergy effi­ciency, but slower, lower band­width, and more volu­mi­nous. This leads to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: add many mil­lions of read-write elec­trodes to sev­eral brain ar­eas, and then con­nect them to each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See “<a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/11/prosthetic-connectivity.html">Pros­thetic con­nec­tivity</a>” for dis­cus­sion of var­i­ants and prob­lems. The main prob­lem is that cur­rent brain im­plants fur­nish &lt;10^4 con­nec­tions, but &gt;10^6 would prob­a­bly be needed to have a ma­jor effect on prob­lem-solv­ing abil­ity, and elec­trodes tend to kill neu­rons at the in­ser­tion site. I don’t know how to ac­cel­er­ate this, as­sum­ing that Neu­ral­ink is already on the ball well enough.</p>
<h2>Hu­man /​ hu­man interface</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: add many thou­sands of read-write elec­trodes to sev­eral brain ar­eas in two differ­ent brains, and then con­nect them to each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If one per­son could think with two brains, they’d be much smarter. Two peo­ple con­nected is not the same thing, but could get some of the benefits. The ad­van­tages of an elec­tric in­ter­face over spo­ken lan­guage are higher band­width, lower la­tency, less cost (pro­duc­ing and de­cod­ing spo­ken words), and po­ten­tially more ex­tro­spec­tive ac­cess (di­rect neu­ral ac­cess to in­ex­plicit neu­ral events). But it’s not clear that there should be much qual­i­ta­tive in­crease in philo­soph­i­cal prob­lem-solv­ing abil­ity.</p>
<p>A key ad­van­tage over pros­thetic con­nec­tivity is that the benefits might re­quire a cou­ple ooms fewer con­nec­tions. That alone makes this method worth try­ing, as it will be prob­a­bly be fea­si­ble soon.</p>
<h2>In­ter­face with brain tis­sue in a vat</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: grow neu­rons in vitro, and then con­nect them to a hu­man brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ad­van­tage of this ap­proach is that it would in prin­ci­ple be scal­able. The main ad­di­tional ob­sta­cle, be­yond any neu­ral-neu­ral in­ter­face ap­proaches, is grow­ing cog­ni­tively use­ful tis­sue in vitro. This is not com­pletely out of the ques­tion——see “DishBrain”——but who knows if it would be fea­si­ble.</p>
<h1>Mas­sive neu­ral transplantation</h1>
<h2>The approach</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: grow &gt;10^8 neu­rons (or ap­pro­pri­ate stem cells) in vitro, and then put them into a hu­man brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been some ex­per­i­ments along these lines, at a smaller scale, aimed at treat­ing brain dam­age.</p>
<p>The idea is sim­ply to scale up the brain’s com­put­ing wet­ware.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<ul><li><p>It would be a com­plex and risky surgery.</p></li><li><p>We don’t know how to make high-qual­ity neu­rons in vitro.</p></li><li><p>The ar­range­ment of the neu­rons might be im­por­tant, and would be harder to repli­cate. Us­ing donor tis­sue might fix this, but be­comes more grue­some and po­ten­tially risky.</p></li><li><p>It might be difficult to get trans­planted tis­sue to in­te­grate. There’s at least some ev­i­dence that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-020-00910-4.pdf">hu­man cere­bral organoids can in­te­grate into mouse brains</a>.</p></li><li><p>Prob­lem-solv­ing might be bot­tle­necked on long-range com­mu­ni­ca­tion rather than neu­ron count.</p></li></ul>
<h1>Sup­port for thinking</h1>
<p>Gen­er­ally, these ap­proaches try to im­prove hu­man think­ing by mod­ify­ing the al­gorithm-like el­e­ments in­volved in think­ing. They are “figure it out our­selves” ap­proaches.</p>
<h2>The approaches</h2>
<p>There is ex­ter­nal sup­port:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: cre­ate ar­ti­facts that offload some el­e­ments of think­ing to a com­puter or other ex­ter­nal de­vice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g. the print­ing press, the text ed­i­tor, the search en­g­ine, the type­checker.</p>
<p>There is men­tal soft­ware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: cre­ate meth­ods of think­ing that im­prove think­ing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g. the prac­tice of math­e­mat­i­cal proof, the prac­tice of notic­ing ra­tio­nal­iza­tion, the prac­tice of in­ves­ti­gat­ing bound­aries.</p>
<p>There is so­cial soft­ware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: cre­ate meth­ods of so­cial or­ga­ni­za­tion that sup­port and mo­ti­vate think­ing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g. a shared nar­ra­tive in which such-and-such cog­ni­tive tasks are worth do­ing, the cul­ture of a pro­duc­tive re­search group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: cre­ate meth­ods of so­cial or­ga­ni­za­tion that con­sti­tute multi-per­son think­ing sys­tems.</p>

How to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer
December 8, 202012:03 AM ET
Bobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle
There's a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do's and don'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I've since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).
It's a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it's worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you're listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?
"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR's Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he's performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.
"A lot of us aren't great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.
But of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.
Figure out what you're trying to accomplish
Like speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?
Playlists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you're going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.

This is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!
Pick the songs
Once you've got your mood in mind, now it's time to pick the songs. Don't be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you're going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It's fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they'll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).
Bobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you're not a professional DJ, he says there's no shame in cheating.
"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.
Crib from other peoples' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it's all fair game.
Structure the playlist like a flight
Generally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That's the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it's a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.
For instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye's "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It's nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He'll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.
Obviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.
This is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It's set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I'm going for.
Surprise!
One of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.
Of course, "new" doesn't have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.

How to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer
December 8, 202012:03 AM ET
Bobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle
There's a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do's and don'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I've since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).
It's a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it's worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you're listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?
"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR's Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he's performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.
"A lot of us aren't great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.
But of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.
Figure out what you're trying to accomplish
Like speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?
Playlists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you're going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.
