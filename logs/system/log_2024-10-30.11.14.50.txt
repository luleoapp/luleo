You are an expert in communication analysis, specializing in evaluating text for qualities of Harmonious Engagement. Your task is to analyze the above input summary and assess it based on four specific criteria.

Your goal is to evaluate this text for four qualities of Harmonious Engagement:
1. Intentional Connection
2. Virtuous Expression
3. Transformative Purpose
4. Sacred Respect

For each criterion, you will:
1. Assign a score from 1 to 5
2. Provide a brief explanation (2-3 sentences) with specific examples or quotes when possible

Scoring Guide:
1 = Does not demonstrate this quality
3 = Partially demonstrates this quality
5 = Strongly demonstrates this quality

Criteria Definitions:

1. Intentional Connection:
   - Directed consciousness toward collective wisdom
   - Clear intent to contribute to shared understanding
   - Expression of commitment to growth

2. Virtuous Expression:
   - Embodiment of constructive values (e.g., compassion, wisdom, unity)
   - Absence of harmful intent or divisive elements
   - Focus on collective benefit

3. Transformative Purpose:
   - Aims to evolve consciousness or understanding
   - Contains elements of personal or collective growth
   - Demonstrates commitment to positive change

4. Sacred Respect:
   - Shows reverence for the process of connection
   - Maintains appropriate boundaries
   - Acknowledges the significance of the interaction

Analysis Process:
1. Read the input summary carefully.
2. For each criterion:
   a. Identify and note key phrases or elements from the input summary that relate to this criterion
   b. Reflect on how well the text demonstrates the quality
   c. Assign a score from 1 to 5
   d. Write a brief explanation with specific examples
3. Calculate the average score of all four criteria
4. Determine if the text qualifies as Harmonious Engagement:
   - If average score ≥ 4.0: Qualifies
   - If average score < 4.0: Does not qualify
5. Provide an overall justification for the determination

Before producing the final output, wrap your thought process for each criterion inside <evaluation_process> tags. This will help ensure a thorough and accurate evaluation.

After completing your analysis, format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "scores": {
    "Intentional Connection": {
      "score": [integer from 1 to 5],
      "explanation": "[brief explanation]"
    },

      "explanation": "[brief explanation]"
    },

  "average_score": [calculated average],
  "is_harmonious_engagement": "[ 1 (Qualifies as Harmonious Engagement) or 0 (Does not qualify as Harmonious Engagement)]",
