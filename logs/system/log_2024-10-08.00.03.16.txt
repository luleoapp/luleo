The analysis estimates that their respective plans would each contribute trillions of dollars to the existing debt levels, raising concerns among economists and policymakers about the long-term fiscal health of the nation. The candidates defend their proposals by arguing that they would stimulate economic growth and help address pressing social issues such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. However, critics argue that the lack of detailed funding strategies raises questions about the sustainability of such ambitious initiatives. They caution that increasing the national debt could lead to higher interest rates, potentially stifling economic growth and placing a greater financial burden on future generations. As the election approaches, voters are urged to consider the implications of each candidate's platform, particularly in the context of fiscal responsibility and the nation's economic future. The ongoing debate highlights the broader tension between immediate social investments and the need for prudent fiscal management, prompting a critical examination of how to achieve a balanced approach to governance that avoids exacerbating national debt."}

2024-10-08 04:02:25,960 - system - INFO - Response JSON: {'summary': "US scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun significantly advanced the understanding of gene regulation within the human body. Their research identified a class of molecules called microRNAs, which play a crucial role in controlling gene expression. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that can bind to messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and inhibit their translation into proteins, effectively regulating the amount and timing of protein production. This discovery not only provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms of genetic control but also has implications for various biological processes, including development, differentiation, and disease progression. Ambros and Ruvkun's groundbreaking work has implications for medicine, notably in the context of cancer, where abnormal microRNA expression can contribute to tumorigenesis. Their findings opened new avenues for understanding how microRNAs may serve as biomarkers for diseases and potential therapeutic targets. The research has sparked further studies into the diverse roles these molecules play in cellular function and their potential applications in genomic medicine, emphasizing the importance of basic research in unraveling complex biological systems."}

<p>One of my fa­vorite sto­ries grow­ing up was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traitor-Star-Wars-Jedi-Order/dp/034542865X">Star Wars: Traitor</a>, by Matthew Stover.</p><p>The book is short, if you want to read it. Spoilers fol­low. (I took a look at it again re­cently and I think it didn’t ob­vi­ously hold up as real adult fic­tion, al­though quite good if you haven’t yet had your mind blown that many times)</p><p>One anec­dote from the story has stayed with me and shows up in my wor­ld­view from time to time.</p><p>The story be­gins with “Ja­cen Solo has been cap­tured, and is be­ing tor­tured.”</p><p>He is be­ing <i>ex­tremely</i> tor­tured. He’s in a white room, with a de­vice con­nected through­out his ner­vous sys­tem, in­flict­ing max­i­mum white-hot agony. When­ever the suffer­ing be­comes so great that his body tunes it out, it gives him just enough time to re­lax to hurt all the more when it abruptly starts up again. </p><p>Every day, an alien woman comes to visit him. She talks to him, dur­ing lulls in the tor­ture, about philos­o­phy and life and his­tory. She asks him what he thinks about things. He says “I think I’m be­ing fuck­ing tor­tured. Can you please help?”, and she kind of ig­nores him and goes on talk­ing about philos­o­phy and life and his­tory and stuff. Some­times he tries more clever ways to pry in­for­ma­tion out of her, to no avail.</p><p>After sev­eral weeks (or months?) of this, at some point he asks again “Se­ri­ously what the hell? Who are you? What is hap­pen­ing to me? Why are you tor­tur­ing me, or, not helping? What is go­ing on?”</p><p>She says: “Do you know what a shad­ow­moth is?”</p><p>“An­swer my fuck­ing ques­tion”</p><p>“Do you know what a shad­ow­moth is?”</p><p>“Fine, a shad­ow­moth is a life form na­tive to Cor­us­cant. They’re sili­con-based, their wingflutes make mu­sic once they leave the co­coon and can fly.”</p><p>She nods, and says “Once, I saw a shad­ow­moth in its co­coon, strug­gling. Like you, I am sen­si­tive to the force – I didn’t merely em­pathize with it, but I felt it. When shad­ow­moths strive to break free from their co­coon, they are in pain. I felt it’s pain. And I felt it’s envy of the other moths, already free, fly­ing, mak­ing mu­sic. I wanted to help it.”</p><p>Ja­cen shud­ders. “Oh no, you didn’t –”</p><p>“Yes. I cut it free.”</p><p>“No –”</p><p>“It sounds like you know what hap­pened next?”</p><p>Ja­cen says: “If they don’t es­cape from the co­coon on their own, they’ll never be strong enough to fly, and they suffer and starve to death, worse than what they were ex­pe­rienc­ing in the co­coon.”</p><p>“In­deed.”<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefm4kuzcus6g9"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnm4kuzcus6g9">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>The two of them sit for awhile. The tor­ture ma­chine gives Ja­cen an­other wave of White Pain. Then the woman says “Sup­pose you did want to help a shad­ow­moth. What would you do, if you couldn’t cut it free? You might sit with it, and let it know that it’s not alone, and that it’s pain is in the ser­vice of it’s des­tiny.”</p><p>And then she leaves for the day.</p><p>And, then, it oc­curs to Ja­cen:</p><p>It’s been months. They haven’t asked him any ques­tions. There is no in­di­ca­tion that they par­tic­u­larly want any­thing from him. There is no in­di­ca­tion that the White Hot Tor­ture will ever stop.</p><p>What would he do, if this was liter­ally the only thing there would ever be? Just him, and the White, and this in­scrutable alien woman...</p><p>...ba­si­cally, the only ac­tion he <i>can</i> do, is to change his re­la­tional stance to the tor­ture, and learn to stop car­ing about it.</p><p>The last sen­tence of that chap­ter is “Ja­cen Solo be­gins to eat away at the White.”</p><p>...</p><p>A few weeks later, he has ba­si­cally in­vented Bud­dhist En­light­en­ment from first prin­ci­ples. He feels the pain, but does not suffer. He con­verses freely with the woman about philos­o­phy and his­tory and life and stuff.</p><p>And, then, his cap­tors say “Con­grat­u­la­tions. You have passed the first test. You are now ready for the sec­ond phase of your train­ing.”<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefsy6o6b4acfm"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnsy6o6b4acfm">[2]</a></sup></span></p><hr /><p>Now, there are a few things I have to say about this.</p><p>First, to fore­stall the ob­vi­ous ob­jec­tions: The tran­shu­man­ist an­swer to “what if painful suffer­ing is nec­es­sary to learn valuable life les­sons?” is <i>“skill is­sue.”</i> </p><p>If you can’t figure out how to let shad­ow­moths out of co­coons with­out them suffer­ing and dy­ing, maybe you can just in­vent bet­ter biotech un­til this is no longer nec­es­sary. In mean­time, sure, have some equa­nim­ity about it. But don’t let that equa­nim­ity stop you from try­ing to im­prove the world.</p><p>But, bet­ter biotech might take thou­sands of years (or, like, at least a decade) to in­vent, and you might have to deal with a situ­a­tion in the mean­while any­way. And I do think there is some­thing pow­er­ful here about <i>never los­ing your lo­cus of con­trol.</i> And there’s some­thing im­por­tant about “Some­times, at least for now, the best way to learn some things in­volves strug­gling and figur­ing things out for your­self. Teach­ers can help point you to the door but you’ll have to walk through it your­self.”</p><p>Also, per­haps the even more ob­vi­ous first ob­jec­tion: in this story, the woman is out to ma­nipu­late Ja­cen into be­com­ing a differ­ent sort of per­son. In the con­text of the story, I think that many of the changes to Ja­cen’s char­ac­ter are ac­tu­ally good by Ja­cen’s origi­nal lights<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefce0hjams2rw"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnce0hjams2rw">[3]</a></sup></span>, but to be clear I do not en­dorse kid­nap­ping peo­ple and tor­tur­ing them even if you can ar­gue it’s for their own good some­how. Or, most things that that would di­rectly be a metaphor for<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefkftf3hbkncf"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnkftf3hbkncf">[4]</a></sup></span>. </p><p>But in the con­text of “things you ac­tu­ally con­sented to”, or “things re­al­ity is forc­ing upon you with­out any­one else re­ally be­ing in­volved at all”, there are two par­tic­u­lar an­gles that come up for me a fair amount.</p><h3><strong>The first an­gle is </strong><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/cbWoMepny3Jo9XqEr/metastrategic-brainstorming-a-core-building-block-skill"><strong>metastrategy</strong></a></h3><p>The goal of my <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/s/skTdjtx87XKurdvWf">ra­tio­nal­ity train­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion</a> is not to pro­duce peo­ple who are good at re­search­ing a par­tic­u­lar do­main, or solv­ing a par­tic­u­lar class of prob­lem. If you are work­ing in a known field, the thing to do is find ex­perts in that field and learn from them. Some­times they may need to im­prove their ped­a­gogy, or learn to ar­tic­u­late their tacit knowl­edge bet­ter. You can learn to <a href="https://commoncog.com/how-to-learn-tacit-knowledge/">ex­tract tacit knowl­edge from peo­ple</a>, and you can learn to ex­tract more knowl­edge from text­books, etc.</p><p>But, for prob­lems <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/CSZnj2YNMKGfsMbZA/specializing-in-problems-we-don-t-understand">we don’t un­der­stand yet</a>, there may just not be an es­tab­lished field to learn from.</p><p>There, you need the skill of ei­ther in­vent­ing new skills, or con­nect­ing dots be­tween dis­parate ex­ist­ing fields that no­body has yet in­te­grated. I think you need some kind of <i>gen­er­al­ized </i>re­search taste, that tells you what to do when no­body in the world is ca­pa­ble of au­thor­i­ta­tively giv­ing you the an­swer, and the spe­cial­ized re­search tastes of var­i­ous fields might be sub­tly lead­ing you astray, like a physi­cist as­sum­ing they can model ev­ery­thing as spher­i­cal cows, or an ML re­searcher <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/67fNBeHrjdrZZNDDK/defining-alignment-research#Valuable_property_2__scientific_approach">as­sum­ing they can con­tinue to be be­hav­iorist about their re­search</a> as they push the fron­tier to­wards su­per­in­tel­li­gence.</p><p>For this rea­son, my <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/JXcuXhtWoyYNWCt5b/interested-in-cognitive-bootcamp">train­ing</a> is very “shad­ow­moth-y”. Much of my pro­cess is “make peo­ple solve a prob­lem they don’t know how to solve, and challenge them to figure it out.” </p><p>I think there is some art to be­ing “ex­actly the right amount of cryp­tic and an­noy­ing”, and to find­ing prob­lems that form a rea­son­able difficulty curve for peo­ple with var­i­ous differ­ent start­ing skills. I don’t know that I’ve hit this bal­ance well yet. The tran­shu­man­ist an­swer to shad­ow­moth­ism still ap­plies – if I can give peo­ple clues that help them learn the right metaskills with­out be­ing so painful and an­noy­ing, all the bet­ter. </p><p>But I try, where pos­si­ble, to only give peo­ple the ear­liest hints on a thought chain, nudg­ing them to­wards the right meta­tools to in­vent/​re­mem­ber the right meta­tools to find/​re­mem­ber the right ob­ject level tools to solve a given prob­lem.</p><h3><strong>The sec­ond an­gle is some­thing like “re­silient self-own­er­ship and lo­cus of con­trol.”</strong></h3><p>Long ago, a friend of mine had re­cently emo­tion­ally grokked ex­is­ten­tial risk – he had known about and “be­lieved in” it for years, but some­how this par­tic­u­lar week things clicked and he was feel­ing more of the full force of it. He felt very afraid, and didn’t know what to do.</p><p>He asked a men­tor for ad­vice. She asked “What does the fear feel like?”</p><p>He didn’t ar­tic­u­late any­thing very clearly.</p><p>She fol­lowed up with “Does it feel more like a tiger is chas­ing you, or more like you want to curl up and hope that your par­ents come and fix it?”</p><p>“The sec­ond one.”</p><p>She nod­ded. “I think that kind of fear does make sense in the an­ces­tral en­vi­ron­ment (and of­ten to­day). Some­times you’re afraid and it <i>is</i> the right thing to do to get help, and maybe curl up to con­serve re­sources mean­while.</p><p>“The thing is, though, that your par­ents re­ally can’t help you here. Mom can’t stop x-risk. So, that kind of fear… it just isn’t very use­ful.”</p><p>I can imag­ine peo­ple for whom this would be ex­actly the wrong thing to say. But, my friend nod­ded, and… some­thing sub­sided in him. Fully un­der­stand­ing what the fear was for, and why it wasn’t helpful, al­lowed him to pro­cess and let go of it. </p><p>“Fully un­der­stand­ing an emo­tion such that you can let it go” is ac­tu­ally a sep­a­rate topic, which de­serves it’s own post. For now, I’m bring­ing this up be­cause the move of: “Oh, my [par­ents/​friends/​so­ciety] ac­tu­ally re­ally won’t save me here, I <i>have</i> to some­how change some­thing in­side my­self in­stead of wait­ing, or try­ing to change some­thing out­side my­self” is an im­por­tant move to be ca­pa­ble of mak­ing some­times.</p><p>This played a role in the first Ma­jor Griev­ing that kicked off my in­ter­est in <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/gs3vp3ukPbpaEie5L/deliberate-grieving-1">De­liber­ate Griev­ing</a> – I thought some­one had wronged me.

2024-10-08 04:02:56,740 - system - INFO - Response JSON: {'summary': "The article reflects on the story 'Star Wars: Traitor' by Matthew Stover, particularly a poignant anecdote involving the character Jacen Solo, who is tortured and engages in philosophical discussions with an alien woman. She compares his struggle to a shadowmoth trapped in a cocoon, highlighting that while the struggle is painful, it is a necessary part of growth. The alien woman's eventual realization is that directly helping the moth can prevent it from developing the strength needed to thrive. This leads to Jacen understanding that he must adapt his relationship with his torture and learn to accept it, which eventually results in a form of enlightenment. The article touches upon the balance between accepting suffering as a learning process and the ethical implications of causing pain for growth. It emphasizes the importance of self-agency, resilience, and understanding one's internal locus of control, while acknowledging that sometimes outside help is necessary. Ultimately, the narrative suggests a blend of tough personal growth experiences with empathy towards oneself, reinforcing that achieving true independence and self-acceptance is essential even in times of struggle."}
