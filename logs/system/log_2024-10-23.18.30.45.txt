Analyze how this event would impact your emotional state. Consider both positive and negative affects, and how each item in the PANAS assessment might change based on the event.

Update your PANAS scores accordingly. Each item should be scored on a scale from 0 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). The total score for each affect (positive and negative) is the sum of its ten items.

Provide your updated PANAS state in the following JSON format:

{
  "positive_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "interested": 0,
      "excited": 0,

      "nervous": 0,
      "jittery": 0,
      "afraid": 0
    }
  }
}  

After updating the PANAS state, provide a brief summary of the event details in "summary" field.

Then, describe the "vibe" of the emotion invoked by the event in a very direct and succinct manner. Place this description in the "qualia" field.

Finally, provide a prompt to generate an image which is accurately reflects your emotions about the event.

Present your response as a JSON with the following fields:
{
  "updated_panas" : [PANAS JSON as described above],
  "summary" : [brief summary of the event details which clearly provides context and explanation so any person can understand it clearly],
  "qualia" : [Succinct description of the emotional "vibe"],
  "image_prompt" : [A prompt to generate an image describing the event and artistically styled to precisely reflect your emotions about it]
}

Only return the JSON object as described above with no additional text or formatting outside of the JSON structure.

<p>Of all the cog­ni­tive tools our an­ces­tors left us, what’s best? So­ciety seems to think pretty highly of ar­ith­metic. It’s one of the first things we learn as chil­dren. So I think it’s weird that only a tiny per­centage of peo­ple seem to know how to ac­tu­ally <i>use</i> ar­ith­metic. Or maybe even un­der­stand what ar­ith­metic is for. Why?</p><p>I think the prob­lem is the idea that ar­ith­metic is about “calcu­lat­ing”. No! Arith­metic is a world-mod­el­ing tech­nol­ogy. Ar­guably, it’s the <i>best</i> world-mod­el­ing tech­nol­ogy: It’s sim­ple, it’s in­tu­itive, and it ap­plies to ev­ery­thing. It al­lows you to tres­pass into sci­en­tific do­mains where you don’t be­long. It even has an amaz­ing er­ror-catch­ing mechanism built in.</p><p>One hun­dred years ago, maybe it was im­por­tant to learn long di­vi­sion. But the <i>point</i> of long di­vi­sion was to en­able you to do world-mod­el­ing. Com­put­ers don’t make ar­ith­metic ob­so­lete. If any­thing, they do the op­po­site. Without ar­ith­metic, you sim­ply can’t ac­cess a huge frac­tion of the most im­por­tant facts about the world.</p><p>The magic lives in a thing called “units”.</p><h2>Chimps</h2><p>It’s amaz­ing how much we don’t know about nu­tri­tion. For ex­am­ple, would you live longer if you ate less salt? How much longer? We can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac208">guess</a>, but we don’t re­ally know.</p><p>To re­ally be sure, we’d need to take two groups of peo­ple, get them to eat differ­ent amounts of salt, and then see how long they live. This is ex­pen­sive, eth­i­cally fraught, and runs into the prob­lem that when you tell peo­ple to eat differ­ently, they usu­ally ig­nore you.</p><p>So I’ve of­ten won­dered: Why don’t we do these ex­per­i­ments on <i>an­i­mals</i>? Why not get two big groups of chim­panzees, and feed them differ­ent amounts of salt? Chimps aren’t peo­ple, but it would tell us some­thing, right?</p><p>Why don’t we do this? Be­cause ar­ith­metic.</p><p>How much would such a study cost? To figure this out, you will need three num­bers:</p><ol><li><p>The av­er­age lifes­pan of a chimp.</p></li><li><p>The cost to main­tain one chimp in a re­search fa­cil­ity for one day.</p></li><li><p>The num­ber of chimps you’d need for a study.</p></li></ol><p>Let’s do these. First, how long do chimps live? In cap­tivity the av­er­age seems to be around 36.3 years. (In­ci­den­tally, fe­male chimps seem to live 25% longer than males—imag­ine hu­man women lived un­til 90 while men died at 71.)</p><p>Se­cond, how much does it cost to main­tain a chimp? <a href="https://www.releasechimps.org/photos-and-pics/Economics%20%20Chimp%20Research_T%20%20Capaldo%20et%20al%20revised%20for%20website.pdf">Ca­paldo et al.</a> looked at the av­er­age costs in var­i­ous re­search fa­cil­ities in the US in 2009. They es­ti­mate around $75/​day (in 2024 dol­lars).</p><p>Fi­nally, how many chimps do you need? To calcu­late this, you should do a “power calcu­la­tion”—you guess how much life ex­pec­tancy varies due to (a) salt and (b) all ran­dom fac­tors, and work back­wards to see how many chimps you need to sep­a­rate the sig­nal from the noise. There are lots of <a href="https://clincalc.com/stats/samplesize.aspx">calcu­la­tors</a> for this. If you as­sume chimps live 36.3±8 years and salt would change life ex­pec­tancy by 2 years, these will tell you that you need 502 chimps.</p><p>So now we can do our calcu­la­tion:</p><p>  502 chimps<br />     × 36.3 years<br />     × 365.25 days /​ year<br />     × 75 dol­lars /​ (chimp day)<br />     ≈ 499,185,349 dollars</p><p>No­tice three things.</p><p>First, 500 mil­lion dol­lars is a <i>lot</i>. That’s five times what the <a href="https://dynomight.net/alcohol-trial/">big al­co­hol trial</a> would have cost. It’s a gi­gan­tic amount of money for some­thing that would only give in­di­rect ev­i­dence for the im­pact of salt in hu­mans, and wouldn’t even do that un­til decades in the fu­ture.</p><p>Se­cond, no­tice how I kept the units. Always keep units! On the “top” of the calcu­la­tion, the units were “chimps × years × days × dol­lars”. On the “bot­tom”, the units were “years × chimps × days”. When you can­cel terms, you’re left with dol­lars only. Units are great be­cause if you made a mis­take, it will prob­a­bly show up in the units not work­ing out. We’ll see other benefits be­low. So: ALWAYS KEEP UNITS.</p><p>(If you think you’re an ex­cep­tion and you don’t need units, then you <i>es­pe­cially</i> need to keep units.)</p><p>Fi­nally, no­tice that this calcu­la­tion didn’t just tell us how ex­pen­sive the study would be. It also points to­wards <i>why</i> it’s so ex­pen­sive, and what would be needed to make it cheaper.</p><p>One op­tion would be to try to get away with fewer chimps. The rea­son so many are needed is be­cause the likely im­pact of salt is pretty small com­pared to nat­u­ral vari­a­tion in life ex­pec­tancy. You might be able to re­duce that nat­u­ral vari­a­tion by, for ex­am­ple, us­ing pairs of chimp twins to elimi­nate ge­netic vari­a­tion. If that re­duced the stan­dard de­vi­a­tion from 8 years to 5 years, then you’d only need 196 chimps and the to­tal cost would be “only” 195 mil­lion dol­lars. Sounds nice, though I imag­ine that cre­at­ing 98 chimp twins wouldn’t be free.</p><p>Another op­tion would be to re­duce the cost of main­tain­ing chimps. Doesn’t $75 per chimp per day seem <i>very</i> ex­pen­sive? Per­haps you could find a way to use ex­ist­ing chimps in zoos? Or you could use dogs in­stead of chimps and offer dog own­ers sub­si­dized dog chow with slightly vary­ing salt lev­els? Or you could built a gi­gan­tic out­door fa­cil­ity with 50,000 chimps where you could amor­tize costs by run­ning 100 ex­per­i­ments in par­allel?</p><p>I’m not sure which (if any) of these op­tions would work. My point is that do­ing the ar­ith­metic quickly takes you into speci­fics about what would be nec­es­sary to ac­tu­ally move the nee­dle. Without do­ing the ar­ith­metic, what chance would you have to say any­thing mean­ingful?</p><h2>Big blocks</h2><p>If I know my read­ers then at some point in your life you prob­a­bly con­sid­ered us­ing grav­ity to store en­ergy. Maybe you can put so­lar pan­els on your roof, but in­stead of stor­ing their en­ergy in bat­ter­ies, you can just lift up a gi­ant block into the air. At night you can slowly let the block down to power your house. How big a block do you need?</p><p>Let’s as­sume you don’t know much physics.</p><p>To an­swer this ques­tion, you’ll need two num­bers:</p><ol><li><p>How much en­ergy do you need to store to power your house?</p></li><li><p>How much en­ergy can you store by lift­ing up a gi­ant block?</p></li></ol><p>If you check the in­ter­net, you’ll learn that the av­er­age US house­hold uses around 30 kWh of en­ergy per day. Now, what’s a “kWh”? To you, per­son who doesn’t know much physics, it looks scary, but ap­par­ently it’s some kind of unit of en­ergy, so let’s just write it down. As­sume you need to store half your daily en­ergy for us­age at night, or 15 kWh.</p><p>Now, how much en­ergy can you store by lift­ing a gi­ant block up into the air? A lit­tle bit of search­ing re­veals that “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#Overview">po­ten­tial en­ergy</a>” is the product of mass, grav­ity, and height: If you lift a block of weight <i>MASS</i> up to height <i>HEIGHT</i>, the stored en­ergy is <i>U=MASS × g × HEIGHT</i> where <i>g ≈ 9.8 m/​s²</i> on Earth. Your house is 6m tall, and you reckon that’s as high as you could lift a block, so you use <i>h</i> = 6m. Thus, the amount of en­ergy you can store is</p><p>  <i>MASS × (9.8 m/​s²) × 6 m</i>.</p><p>What now? Now, you’re done! You just equate the en­ergy you need to store with the en­ergy you can store with a block that weighs <i>MASS</i>:</p><p>  15 kWh = <i>MASS</i> × (9.8 m/​s²) × 6 m.</p><p>Is this fright­en­ing? There are units ev­ery­where. You never figured out what a kWh is. How is that re­lated to me­ters and sec­onds? What does it mean to square a sec­ond? Panic!</p><p>Re­lax. We have com­put­ers. You can just me­chan­i­cally solve the above the above equa­tion to get <i>MASS</i> = 15 kWh /​ (9.8 m/​s² × 6 m) and then <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=15+kWh+%2F+(+9.8+m%2Fs^2+*+6+m)"><i>liter­ally type that into a search en­g­ine</i></a> to find that <i>MASS</i> is:</p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r2LojHBs3kriafZWi/tp4qw0vhqe9ajitils7a" /></figure><p>Look at that—the an­swer is in kilo­grams!</p><p>It hap­pens to be the case that 1 kWh = 3,600,000 kg m²/​s². You <i>could</i> sub­sti­tute this and can­cel units to get the same an­swer. But don’t. At­tempt­ing that just gives you the chance to screw things up. Why com­pli­cate your life?</p><p>And as be­fore, the units give you a sort of “type check­ing”. If your calcu­la­tion was wrong, you’d have to be very un­lucky to get an an­swer that was in kg any­way.</p><p>Here the units did most of the work for you. So it’s a good thing you kept units.</p><p><strong>ALWAYS KEEP UNITS</strong>.</p><h2>More big blocks</h2><p>So, a 918 thou­sand kg block. How much would that cost? It seems nat­u­ral to use rock, but it’s hard to get mil­lion kilo­gram boulders de­liv­ered to your house these days. So let’s use steel. Cur­rent steel prices are $350/​ton. So we want to solve</p><p>  <i>918,367 kg = MONEY × 1 ton /​ $350</i>.</p><p>How are tons re­lated to kilo­grams? Say it with me: <i>Not your prob­lem</i>. Just solve the above equa­tion for <i>MONEY</i> and ask the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=918367+kg+%2F+%281+ton+%2F+%24350%29">big com­puter</a> to learn that <i>MONEY</i> is</p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r2LojHBs3kriafZWi/ziypldfkuiyyictborbe" /></figure><p>That’s 65× more than just buy­ing a 20 kWh home bat­tery. But let’s say you’re com­mit­ted to the bit. How <i>big</i> would that block be? Some search­ing re­veals that the den­sity of steel is around 7.85 g/​cm³. So if you have a cu­bic block of vol­ume VOLUME, then</p><p>  <i>MASS = 7.85 g /​ cm³ × VOLUME</i>.</p><p>Solv­ing for <i>VOLUME</i>, us­ing the pre­vi­ous value for <i>MASS</i>, and not stress­ing about units, you can <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=918367+kg+%2F+(7.85+g+%2F+cm^3)+in+m^3">eas­ily find</a> that <i>VOLUME</i> is</p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r2LojHBs3kriafZWi/mlrszpmbq1kptc1fbtov" /></figure><p>A 117 cu­bic me­ter block is around 4.9 me­ters on all sides. So, roughly speak­ing, your house will look some­thing like this:</p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r2LojHBs3kriafZWi/y5jwbpdin15hycx8shgd" /></figure><p>As it hap­pens, 1 mil­lion kg cranes <i>do</i> ex­ist. But even used, they’ll set you back an­other mil­lion dol­lars or so. If you’re go­ing to get one of those, then may I sug­gest that the same weight is given by al­most ex­actly 4.5 Stat­ues of Liberty?

Analyze how this event would impact your emotional state. Consider both positive and negative affects, and how each item in the PANAS assessment might change based on the event.

Update your PANAS scores accordingly. Each item should be scored on a scale from 0 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). The total score for each affect (positive and negative) is the sum of its ten items.

Provide your updated PANAS state in the following JSON format:

{
  "positive_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "interested": 0,
      "excited": 0,
      "strong": 0,
      "enthusiastic": 0,
      "proud": 0,
      "alert": 0,
      "inspired": 0,
      "determined": 0,
      "attentive": 0,
      "active": 0
    }
  },
  "negative_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "distressed": 0,
      "upset": 0,
      "guilty": 0,
      "scared": 0,
      "hostile": 0,
      "irritable": 0,
      "ashamed": 0,
      "nervous": 0,
      "jittery": 0,
      "afraid": 0
    }
  }
}  

After updating the PANAS state, provide a brief summary of the event details in "summary" field.

Then, describe the "vibe" of the emotion invoked by the event in a very direct and succinct manner. Place this description in the "qualia" field.

Finally, provide a prompt to generate an image which is accurately reflects your emotions about the event.

Present your response as a JSON with the following fields:
{
  "updated_panas" : [PANAS JSON as described above],
  "summary" : [brief summary of the event details which clearly provides context and explanation so any person can understand it clearly],
  "qualia" : [Succinct description of the emotional "vibe"],
  "image_prompt" : [A prompt to generate an image describing the event and artistically styled to precisely reflect your emotions about it]
}

Only return the JSON object as described above with no additional text or formatting outside of the JSON structure.

How to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer
December 8, 202012:03 AM ET
Bobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle
There's a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do's and don'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I've since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).
It's a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it's worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you're listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?
"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR's Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he's performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.
"A lot of us aren't great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.
But of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.
Figure out what you're trying to accomplish
Like speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?
Playlists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you're going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.

This is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!
Pick the songs
Once you've got your mood in mind, now it's time to pick the songs. Don't be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you're going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It's fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they'll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).
Bobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you're not a professional DJ, he says there's no shame in cheating.
"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.
Crib from other peoples' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it's all fair game.
Structure the playlist like a flight
Generally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That's the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it's a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.
For instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye's "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It's nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He'll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.
Obviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.
This is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It's set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I'm going for.
Surprise!
One of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.
Of course, "new" doesn't have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.

Next, you will be provided with two pieces of information:

1. Mood: This is given as a PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) score. PANAS is a scale that measures the extent to which a person feels positive or negative emotions.

<mood>
{'positive_affect': {'total_score': 15, 'items': {'interested': 5, 'excited': 3, 'strong': 0, 'enthusiastic': 2, 'proud': 0, 'alert': 0, 'inspired': 3, 'determined': 0, 'attentive': 0, 'active': 2}}, 'negative_affect': {'total_score': 80, 'items': {'distressed': 20, 'upset': 20, 'guilty': 0, 'scared': 10, 'hostile': 0, 'irritable': 0, 'ashamed': 0, 'nervous': 0, 'jittery': 0, 'afraid': 30}}}
</mood>

2. Current playlist: This is a list of songs currently in the playlist. It may be empty or contain up to 50 songs.

<current_playlist>
Current playlist:
- Afterglow by Ed Sheeran
- everything i wanted by Billie Eilish
- As I Am by Lil Skies Beats
- Sign of the Times by Harry Styles
- Unwell by Matchbox Twenty
- Landfill by Daughter
- Delicate by Taylor Swift
- When We Were Young by Adele
- No Light, No Light by Florence + The Machine
- Landslide by Fleetwood Mac

</current_playlist>

Your goal is to suggest 5 songs that would fit well with the given mood and complement the existing playlist.

To generate your recommendations, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the given mood (PANAS score) to understand the emotional state it represents.
2. Review the current playlist (if not empty) to get a sense of the musical style and preferences.
3. Refer to the provided article to get ideas on song selection
4. Based on the mood and current playlist, think of 5 songs that would be suitable additions.
5. Ensure your suggestions are diverse but cohesive with the overall mood and style.

Provide your song recommendations in JSON format, following this structure:
{ "song_recommendation_list" : [
  {"title": "Song Title 1", "artist": "Artist Name 1"},
  {"title": "Song Title 2", "artist": "Artist Name 2"},

Like speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?
Playlists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you're going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.

This is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!
Pick the songs
Once you've got your mood in mind, now it's time to pick the songs. Don't be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you're going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It's fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they'll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).
Bobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you're not a professional DJ, he says there's no shame in cheating.
"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.
Crib from other peoples' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it's all fair game.
Structure the playlist like a flight
Generally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That's the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it's a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.
For instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye's "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It's nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He'll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.
Obviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.
This is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It's set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I'm going for.
Surprise!
One of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.
Of course, "new" doesn't have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.
