During a recent campaign event, she highlighted the importance of candidates being open about their health, arguing that voters deserve to know crucial information that could impact their leadership. The nominee criticized her opponent for what she referred to as a 'cloud of secrecy' surrounding his medical records and overall well-being. She emphasized that health is a pivotal factor in assessing a potential leader’s fitness for office, particularly in times of crisis. The accusations come as both candidates prepare for upcoming debates and campaign events that could shape public perception. In response, her rival's camp has dismissed the concerns, claiming that he is in good health and that the focus should remain on policy issues rather than personal matters. This exchange underscores the heightened scrutiny both candidates face as they seek to secure voter support in a highly competitive race. The debate over health transparency reflects broader concerns regarding accountability and the public's right to evaluate candidates based on their overall fitness to serve in high office."}

Trump's assertions suggest that immigrants pose a serious threat to the electoral process, which has sparked a significant political debate.

The article emphasizes the importance of fact-checking and understanding the legal framework surrounding voting rights, which explicitly reserves the right to vote for U.S. citizens.

He became the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 2004, revitalizing the party and leading it to notable electoral successes, including the 2007 Scottish Parliament elections where the SNP formed a minority government for the first time. Under Salmond's leadership, the party campaigned for a referendum on Scottish independence, which culminated in the 2014 vote.

<h1>Call to action</h1>
<p>If you have a shit­load of money, there are some pro­jects you can give money to that would make su­per­ge­nius hu­mans on de­mand hap­pen faster. If you have a fuck­ton of money, there are pro­jects whose cre­ation you could fund that would greatly ac­cel­er­ate this tech­nol­ogy.</p>
<p>If you’re young and smart, or are already an ex­pert in ei­ther stem cell /​ re­pro­duc­tive biol­ogy, biotech, or any­thing re­lated to brain-com­puter in­ter­faces, there are some pro­jects you could work on.</p>
<p>If nei­ther, think hard, maybe I missed some­thing.</p>

<h1>Context</h1>
<h2>The goal</h2>
<p>What em­pow­ers hu­man­ity is the abil­ity of hu­mans to no­tice, rec­og­nize, re­mem­ber, cor­re­late, ideate, tin­ker, ex­plain, test, judge, com­mu­ni­cate, in­ter­ro­gate, and de­sign. To in­crease hu­man em­pow­er­ment, im­prove those abil­ities by im­prov­ing their source: hu­man brains.</p>
<p>AGI is go­ing to de­stroy the fu­ture’s promise of mas­sive hu­mane value. To pre­vent that, cre­ate hu­mans who can nav­i­gate the cre­ation of AGI. Hu­mans al­ive now can’t figure out how to make AGI that leads to a hu­mane uni­verse.</p>
<p>Th­ese are de­sir­able virtues: philo­soph­i­cal prob­lem-solv­ing abil­ity, cre­ativity, wis­dom, taste, mem­ory, speed, clev­er­ness, un­der­stand­ing, judge­ment. Th­ese virtues de­pend on men­tal and so­cial soft­ware, but can also be en­hanced by en­hanc­ing hu­man brains.</p>
<p>How much? To nav­i­gate the cre­ation of AGI will likely re­quire solv­ing philo­soph­i­cal prob­lems that are be­yond the ca­pa­bil­ities of the cur­rent pop­u­la­tion of hu­mans, given the available time (some decades). Six stan­dard de­vi­a­tions is 1 in 10^9, seven stan­dard de­vi­a­tions is 1 in 10^12. So the goal is to cre­ate many peo­ple who are 7 SDs above the mean in cog­ni­tive ca­pa­bil­ities. That’s “strong hu­man in­tel­li­gence am­plifi­ca­tion”. (Why not more SDs? There are <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/08/downside-risks-of-genomic-selection.html">many down­side risks</a> to chang­ing the pro­cess that cre­ates hu­mans, so go­ing fur­ther is an un­nec­es­sary risk.)</p>
<p>It is my con­vic­tion that this is the only way for­ward for hu­man­ity.</p>
<h2>Con­straint: Alger­non’s law</h2>
<p><a href="https://gwern.net/drug-heuristic">Alger­non’s law</a>: If there’s a change to hu­man brains that hu­man-evolu­tion could have made, but didn’t, then it is net-neu­tral or net-nega­tive for in­clu­sive rel­a­tive ge­netic fit­ness. If in­tel­li­gence is ce­teris paribus a fit­ness ad­van­tage, then a change to hu­man brains that in­creases in­tel­li­gence must ei­ther come with other dis­ad­van­tages or else be in­ac­cessible to evolu­tion.</p>
<p>Ways around Alger­non’s law, in­creas­ing in­tel­li­gence any­way:</p>
<ul><li><p>We could ap­ply a stronger se­lec­tion pres­sure than hu­man-evolu­tion ap­plied. The se­lec­tion pres­sure that hu­man-evolu­tion ap­plied to hu­mans is capped (some­how) by the vari­a­tion of IGF among all germline cells. So it can only push down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_load">mu­ta­tional load</a> to some point.</p></li><li><p>Maybe (re­cent, per­haps) hu­man-evolu­tion se­lected against in­tel­li­gence be­yond some point.</p></li><li><p>We could come up with bet­ter de­sign ideas for mind-hard­ware.</p></li><li><p>We could use re­sources that evolu­tion didn’t have. We have metal, wires, ra­dios, ba­si­cally un­limited elec­tric and metabolic power, re­li­able high-qual­ity nu­tri­tion, me­chan­i­cal cool­ing de­vices, etc.</p></li><li><p>Given our re­sources, some prop­er­ties that would have been dis­ad­van­tages are no longer ma­jor dis­ad­van­tages. E.g. a higher metabolic cost is barely a mean­ingful cost.</p></li><li><p>We have differ­ent val­ues from evolu­tion; we might want to trade away IGF to gain in­tel­li­gence.</p></li></ul>
<h2>How to know what makes a smart brain</h2>
<h3>Figure it out ourselves</h3>
<ul><li><p>We can test in­ter­ven­tions and see what works.</p></li><li><p>We can think about what, me­chan­i­cally, the brain needs in or­der to func­tion well.</p></li><li><p>We can think about think­ing and then think of ways to think bet­ter.</p></li></ul>
<h3>Copy na­ture’s work</h3>
<ul><li><p>There are seven billion nat­u­ral ex­per­i­ments, juz run­nin aroun doin stuff. We can ob­serve the be­hav­iors of the hu­mans and learn what cir­cum­stances of their cre­ation leads to fewer or more cog­ni­tive ca­pa­bil­ities.</p></li><li><p>We can see what hu­man-evolu­tion in­vested in, aimed at cog­ni­tive ca­pa­bil­ities, and add more of that.</p></li></ul>
<h1>Brain emulation</h1>
<h2>The approach</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: figure out how neu­rons work, scan hu­man brains, make a simu­la­tion of a scanned brain, and then use soft­ware im­prove­ments to make the brain think bet­ter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is to have a hu­man brain, but with the ad­van­tages of be­ing in a com­puter: faster pro­cess­ing, more scal­able hard­ware, more in­tro­spectable (e.g. read ac­cess to all in­ter­nals, even if they are ob­scured; com­pu­ta­tion traces), re­pro­ducible com­pu­ta­tions, A/​B test­ing com­po­nents or other tweaks, low-level op­ti­miz­able, pro­cess fork­ing. This is a “figure it out our­selves” method——we’d have to figure out what makes the em­u­lated brain smarter.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>While we have some han­dle on the fast (&lt;1 sec­ond) pro­cesses that hap­pen in a neu­ron, no one knows much about the slow (&gt;5 sec­ond) pro­cesses. The slow pro­cesses are nec­es­sary for what we care about in think­ing. Peo­ple work­ing on brain em­u­la­tion mostly aren’t work­ing on this prob­lem be­cause they have enough prob­lems as it is.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ex­per­i­ments here, the sort that would give 0-to-1 end-to-end feed­back about whether the whole thing is work­ing, would be ex­tremely ex­pen­sive; and unit tests are much harder to cal­ibrate (what refer­ence to use?).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Par­tial suc­cess could con­sti­tute a ma­jor AGI ad­vance, which would be ex­tremely dan­ger­ous. Un­like most of the other ap­proaches listed here, brain em­u­la­tions wouldn’t be hard­ware-bound (skull-size bound).</p>
</li><li>
<p>The po­ten­tial for value drift——mak­ing a hu­man-like mind with al­tered /​ dis­torted /​ alien val­ues——is much higher here than with the other ap­proaches. This might be es­pe­cially se­lected for: sub­cor­ti­cal brain struc­tures, which are es­pe­cially value-laden, are more phys­iolog­i­cally het­ero­ge­neous than cor­ti­cal struc­tures, and there­fore would re­quire sub­stan­tially more sci­en­tific work to model ac­cu­rately. Fur­ther: be­cause the em­u­la­tion ap­proach is based on copy­ing as much as pos­si­ble and then filling in de­tails by see­ing what works, many de­tails will be filled in by non-hu­mane pro­cesses (such as the shap­ing pro­cesses in nor­mal hu­man child­hood).</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Fun­da­men­tally, brain em­u­la­tions are a 0-to-1 move, whereas the other ap­proaches take a nor­mal hu­man brain as the ba­sic en­g­ine and then mod­ify it in some way. The 0-to-1 ap­proach is more difficult, more spec­u­la­tive, and riskier.</p>
<h1>Ge­nomic approaches</h1>
<p>Th­ese ap­proaches look at the 7 billion nat­u­ral ex­per­i­ments and see which ge­netic var­i­ants cor­re­late with in­tel­li­gence. IQ is a very im­perfect but mea­surable and suffi­cient proxy for prob­lem-solv­ing abil­ity. Since &gt;7 of ev­ery 10 IQ points are ex­plained by ge­netic vari­a­tion, we can ex­tract a lot of what na­ture knows about what makes brains have many ca­pa­bil­ities. We can’t get that knowl­edge about ca­pa­ble brains in a form us­able as en­g­ineer­ing (to build a brain from scratch), but we can at least get it in a form us­able as scores (which genomes make brains with fewer or more ca­pa­bil­ities). Th­ese are “copy na­ture’s work” ap­proaches.</p>
<h2>Adult brain gene editing</h2>
<h3>The approach</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: edit IQ-pos­i­tive var­i­ants into the brain cells of adult hu­mans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See “<a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/JEhW3HDMKzekDShva/significantly-enhancing-adult-intelligence-with-gene-editing">Sig­nifi­cantly En­hanc­ing …</a>”.</p>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>De­liv­ery is difficult.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Edi­tors dam­age DNA.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The effect is greatly at­ten­u­ated, com­pared to germline ge­net­ics. In adult­hood, learn­ing win­dows have been passed by; many genes are no longer ac­tive; dam­age that ac­cu­mu­lates has already been ac­cu­mu­lated; many cells don’t re­ceive the ed­its. This adds up to an op­ti­mistic ceiling some­where around +2 or +3 SDs.</p>
</li></ul>
<h2>Germline engineering</h2>
<p>This is the way that will work. (Note that there are <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/08/downside-risks-of-genomic-selection.html">many down­side risks to germline en­g­ineer­ing</a>, though AFAICT they can be alle­vi­ated to such an ex­tent that the trade­off is worth it by far.)</p>
<h3>The approach</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: make a baby from a cell that has a genome that has many IQ-pos­i­tive ge­netic var­i­ants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sub­tasks:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><em>Know what genome would pro­duce ge­niuses.</em> This is already solved well enough. Be­cause there are already poly­genic scores for IQ that ex­plain &gt;12% of the ob­served var­i­ance in IQ (<a href="http://pgscatalog.org/score/PGS003724/">pgscat­a­log.org/​score/​PGS003724/​</a>), 10 SDs of raw se­lec­tion power would trans­late into trait se­lec­tion power at a rate greater than √(1/​9) = <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub></span>, giv­ing &gt;3.3 SDs of IQ trait se­lec­tion power, i.e. +50 IQ points.</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Make a cell with such a genome.</em> This is prob­a­bly not that hard——via CRISPR edit­ing stem cells, via <a href="https://denovo.substack.com/p/meiosis-is-all-you-need">iter­ated meiotic se­lec­tion</a>, or via chro­mo­some se­lec­tion. My <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/08/the-power-of-selection.html#3-selecting-all-of-many-components">math</a> and simu­la­tions show that sev­eral meth­ods would achieve strong in­tel­li­gence am­plifi­ca­tion. If in­duced meio­sis into cul­turable cells is de­vel­oped, IMS can provide &gt;10 SDs of raw se­lec­tion power given very roughly $10^5 and a few months.</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Know what epige­nomic state (in sperm /​ egg /​ zy­gote) leads to healthy de­vel­op­ment.</em> This is not fully un­der­stood——it’s an open prob­lem that can be worked on.</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Given a cell, make a de­rived cell (diploid mi­totic or hap­loid meiotic offspring cell) with that epige­nomic state.</em> This is not fully un­der­stood——it’s an open prob­lem that can be worked on. This is the main bot­tle­neck.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Th­ese tasks don’t nec­es­sar­ily com­pletely fac­tor out. For ex­am­ple, some ap­proaches might try to “pig­gy­back” off the nat­u­ral epige­nomic re­set by us­ing chro­mo­somes from nat­u­ral ga­metes or zy­gotes, which will have the cor­rect epige­nomic state already.</p>
<p>See also Bran­wen, “<a href="https://gwern.net/embryo-selection">Em­bryo Selec­tion …</a>”.</p>
<p>More in­for­ma­tion on re­quest. Some of the im­por­tant re­search is hap­pen­ing, but there’s always room for more fund­ing and tal­ent.</p>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>It takes a long time; the baby has to grow up. (But <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2023/07/views-on-when-agi-comes-and-on-strategy.html">we prob­a­bly have time</a>, and de­lay­ing AGI only helps if you have an out.)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Cor­rect­ing the epige­nomic state of a cell to be de­vel­op­men­tally com­pe­tent is un­solved.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The baby can’t con­sent, un­like with other ap­proaches, which work with adults. (But the baby can also be made ge­nom­i­cally dis­posed to be ex­cep­tion­ally healthy and sane.)</p>
</li><li>
<p>It’s the most poli­ti­cally con­tentious ap­proach.</p>
</li></ul>
<h1>Sig­nal­ing molecules for cre­ative brains</h1>
<h2>The approach</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: iden­tify mas­ter sig­nal­ing molecules that con­trol brain ar­eas or brain de­vel­op­men­tal stages that are as­so­ci­ated with prob­lem-solv­ing abil­ity; treat adult brains with those sig­nal­ing molecules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to evolved mod­u­lar­ity, or­ganic sys­tems are gov­erned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_regulatory_network">ge­nomic reg­u­la­tory net­works</a>. Maybe we can iso­late and ar­tifi­cially ac­ti­vate GRNs that gen­er­ate phys­iolog­i­cal states that pro­duce cog­ni­tive ca­pa­bil­ities not oth­er­wise available in a de­fault adult’s brain. The hope is that there’s a very small set of mas­ter reg­u­la­tors that can turn on larger cir­cuits with strong or­ches­trated effects, as is the case with hor­mones, so that treat­ments are rel­a­tively sim­ple, high-lev­er­age, and dis­cov­er­able. For ex­am­ple, maybe we could repli­cate the sig­nal­ing con­text that ac­ti­vates childish learn­ing ca­pa­bil­ities, or maybe we could repli­cate the sig­nal­ing con­text that ac­ti­vates pari­etal prob­lem-solv­ing in more brain tis­sue.</p>
<p>I haven’t looked into this enough to know whether or not it makes sense. This is a “copy na­ture’s work” ap­proach: na­ture knows more about how to make brains that are good at think­ing, than what is ex­pressed in a nor­mal adult hu­man.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Who knows what nega­tive effects might re­sult.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Learn­ing win­dows might be ir­re­versibly lost af­ter child­hood, e.g. by long-range con­nec­tions be­ing ir­recov­er­ably pruned.</p>
</li></ul>
<h1>Brain-brain elec­tri­cal in­ter­face approaches</h1>
<p>Brain-com­puter in­ter­faces don’t ob­vi­ously give an op­por­tu­nity for large in­creases in cre­ative philo­soph­i­cal prob­lem-solv­ing abil­ity. See the dis­cus­sion in “<a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/11/prosthetic-connectivity.html">Pros­thetic con­nec­tivity</a>”. The fun­da­men­tal prob­lem is that we, pro­gram­ming the com­puter part, don’t know how to write code that does trans­for­ma­tions that will be use­ful for neu­ral minds.</p>
<p>But brain-brain in­ter­faces——adding con­nec­tions be­tween brain tis­sues that nor­mally aren’t con­nected——might in­crease those abil­ities. Th­ese ap­proaches use elec­trodes to read elec­tri­cal sig­nals from neu­rons, then trans­mit those sig­nals (per­haps com­pressed/​filtered/​trans­formed) through wires /​ fiber op­tic ca­bles /​ EM waves, then write them to other neu­rons through other elec­trodes. Th­ese are “copy na­ture’s work” ap­proaches, in the sense that we think na­ture made neu­rons that know how to ar­range them­selves use­fully when con­nected with other neu­rons.</p>
<h2>Prob­lems with all elec­tri­cal brain in­ter­face approaches</h2>
<ul><li><p><em>The butcher num­ber.</em> Cur­rent elec­trodes kill more neu­rons than they record. That doesn’t scale safely to mil­lions of con­nec­tions.</p></li><li><p><em>Bad feed­back.</em> Neu­ral synapses are not strictly feed­for­ward; there is of­ten re­cip­ro­cal sig­nal­ing and reg­u­la­tion. Elec­trodes wouldn’t com­mu­ni­cate that sort of feed­back, which might be im­por­tant for learn­ing.</p></li></ul>
<h2>Mas­sive cere­bral pros­thetic connectivity</h2>
<p class="imgonly"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/jTiSWHKAtnyA723LE/tip85f1cbyiqytbckaoy" /></p>
<p>Source: <a class="bare-url" href="https://www.neuromedia.ca/white-matter/">https://​​www.neu­ro­me­dia.ca/​​white-mat­ter/​​</a></p>
<p>Half of the hu­man brain is white mat­ter, i.e. neu­ronal ax­ons with fatty sheaths around them to make them trans­mit sig­nals faster. White mat­ter is ~1/​10 the vol­ume of ro­dent brains, but ~1/​2 the vol­ume of hu­man brains. Wiring is ex­pen­sive and gets min­i­mized; see “Prin­ci­ples of Neu­ral De­sign” by Ster­ling and Laugh­lin. All these long-range ax­ons are a huge metabolic ex­pense. That means fast, long-range, high band­width (so to speak——there are many differ­ent points in­volved) com­mu­ni­ca­tion is im­por­tant to cog­ni­tive ca­pa­bil­ities. See <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/white-matter">here</a>.</p>
<p>A bet­ter-re­searched com­par­i­son would be helpful. But vaguely, my guess is that if we com­pare long-range neu­ronal ax­ons to metal wires, fiber op­tic ca­bles, or EM trans­mis­sions, we’d see (amor­tized over mil­lions of con­nec­tions): ax­ons are in the same bal­l­park in terms of en­ergy effi­ciency, but slower, lower band­width, and more volu­mi­nous. This leads to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: add many mil­lions of read-write elec­trodes to sev­eral brain ar­eas, and then con­nect them to each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See “<a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/11/prosthetic-connectivity.html">Pros­thetic con­nec­tivity</a>” for dis­cus­sion of var­i­ants and prob­lems. The main prob­lem is that cur­rent brain im­plants fur­nish &lt;10^4 con­nec­tions, but &gt;10^6 would prob­a­bly be needed to have a ma­jor effect on prob­lem-solv­ing abil­ity, and elec­trodes tend to kill neu­rons at the in­ser­tion site. I don’t know how to ac­cel­er­ate this, as­sum­ing that Neu­ral­ink is already on the ball well enough.</p>
<h2>Hu­man /​ hu­man interface</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: add many thou­sands of read-write elec­trodes to sev­eral brain ar­eas in two differ­ent brains, and then con­nect them to each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If one per­son could think with two brains, they’d be much smarter. Two peo­ple con­nected is not the same thing, but could get some of the benefits. The ad­van­tages of an elec­tric in­ter­face over spo­ken lan­guage are higher band­width, lower la­tency, less cost (pro­duc­ing and de­cod­ing spo­ken words), and po­ten­tially more ex­tro­spec­tive ac­cess (di­rect neu­ral ac­cess to in­ex­plicit neu­ral events). But it’s not clear that there should be much qual­i­ta­tive in­crease in philo­soph­i­cal prob­lem-solv­ing abil­ity.</p>
<p>A key ad­van­tage over pros­thetic con­nec­tivity is that the benefits might re­quire a cou­ple ooms fewer con­nec­tions. That alone makes this method worth try­ing, as it will be prob­a­bly be fea­si­ble soon.</p>
<h2>In­ter­face with brain tis­sue in a vat</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: grow neu­rons in vitro, and then con­nect them to a hu­man brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ad­van­tage of this ap­proach is that it would in prin­ci­ple be scal­able. The main ad­di­tional ob­sta­cle, be­yond any neu­ral-neu­ral in­ter­face ap­proaches, is grow­ing cog­ni­tively use­ful tis­sue in vitro. This is not com­pletely out of the ques­tion——see “DishBrain”——but who knows if it would be fea­si­ble.</p>
<h1>Mas­sive neu­ral transplantation</h1>
<h2>The approach</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: grow &gt;10^8 neu­rons (or ap­pro­pri­ate stem cells) in vitro, and then put them into a hu­man brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been some ex­per­i­ments along these lines, at a smaller scale, aimed at treat­ing brain dam­age.</p>
<p>The idea is sim­ply to scale up the brain’s com­put­ing wet­ware.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<ul><li><p>It would be a com­plex and risky surgery.</p></li><li><p>We don’t know how to make high-qual­ity neu­rons in vitro.</p></li><li><p>The ar­range­ment of the neu­rons might be im­por­tant, and would be harder to repli­cate. Us­ing donor tis­sue might fix this, but be­comes more grue­some and po­ten­tially risky.</p></li><li><p>It might be difficult to get trans­planted tis­sue to in­te­grate. There’s at least some ev­i­dence that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-020-00910-4.pdf">hu­man cere­bral organoids can in­te­grate into mouse brains</a>.</p></li><li><p>Prob­lem-solv­ing might be bot­tle­necked on long-range com­mu­ni­ca­tion rather than neu­ron count.</p></li></ul>
<h1>Sup­port for thinking</h1>
<p>Gen­er­ally, these ap­proaches try to im­prove hu­man think­ing by mod­ify­ing the al­gorithm-like el­e­ments in­volved in think­ing. They are “figure it out our­selves” ap­proaches.</p>
<h2>The approaches</h2>
<p>There is ex­ter­nal sup­port:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: cre­ate ar­ti­facts that offload some el­e­ments of think­ing to a com­puter or other ex­ter­nal de­vice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g. the print­ing press, the text ed­i­tor, the search en­g­ine, the type­checker.</p>
<p>There is men­tal soft­ware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: cre­ate meth­ods of think­ing that im­prove think­ing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g. the prac­tice of math­e­mat­i­cal proof, the prac­tice of notic­ing ra­tio­nal­iza­tion, the prac­tice of in­ves­ti­gat­ing bound­aries.</p>
<p>There is so­cial soft­ware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: cre­ate meth­ods of so­cial or­ga­ni­za­tion that sup­port and mo­ti­vate think­ing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g. a shared nar­ra­tive in which such-and-such cog­ni­tive tasks are worth do­ing, the cul­ture of a pro­duc­tive re­search group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Method: cre­ate meth­ods of so­cial or­ga­ni­za­tion that con­sti­tute multi-per­son think­ing sys­tems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g. git.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>What about weak amplification</h2>
<p>Get­ting rid of lead poi­son­ing should ab­solutely be a pri­or­ity. It won’t greatly in­crease hu­man­ity’s max­i­mum in­tel­li­gence level though.</p>
<h2>What about …</h2>
<ul><li><p>BCIs? weaksauce</p></li><li><p>Nootrop­ics? weaksauce</p></li><li><p>Brain train­ing? weaksauce</p></li><li><p>Trans­plant­ing bird neu­rons? Seems risky and un­likely to work.</p></li><li><p>Some­thing some­thing blood­flow? weaksauce</p></li><li><p>Tran­scra­nial mag­netic stim­u­la­tion? IDK, prob­a­bly weak­sauce. This is a “count­ing up from nega­tive up to zero” thing; might re­move in­hi­bi­tions or trauma re­sponses, or add use­ful noise that breaks anti-helpful states, or some­thing. But it won’t raise the cap on in­sight, prob­a­bly——peo­ple some­times get to have their peak prob­lem solv­ing some­times any­way.</p></li><li><p>Ul­tra­sound? ditto</p></li><li><p>Neu­ro­feed­back? Pos­si­bly… seems like a bet­ter bet than other stuff like this, but prob­a­bly weak­sauce.</p></li><li><p>Get­ting good sleep? weak­sauce——good but doesn’t make supergeniuses</p></li><li><p>Gut micro­biome? weaksauce</p></li><li><p>Mnemonic sys­tems? weaksauce</p></li><li><p>Soft­ware exo­brain? weaksauces</p></li><li><p>LLMs? no</p></li><li><p>Psychedelics? stop</p></li><li><p>Bud­dhism? Aahhh, I don’t think you get what this is about</p></li><li><p>Em­brac­ing evil? go away</p></li><li><p>Ro­tat­ing ar­modafinil, dex­tromethor­phan, caf­feine, nico­tine, and lis­dex­am­fe­tamine? AAHHH NOOO</p></li><li><p>[redacted]? Ab­solutely not. Go sit in the cor­ner and think about what you were even think­ing of do­ing.</p></li></ul>
<h2>The real in­tel­li­gence en­hance­ment is …</h2>
<p>Look, I’m all for heal­ing so­ciety, heal­ing trauma, in­creas­ing col­lec­tive con­scious­ness, cre­at­ing a shared vi­sion of the fu­ture, rid­ding our­selves of ma­lign egre­gores, blah blah. I’m all for it. But it’s a difficult, thinky prob­lem. …So difficult that you might need some good think­ing help with that thinky prob­lem...</p>
<h2>Is this good to do?</h2>
<p>Yeah, prob­a­bly. There are <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/08/downside-risks-of-genomic-selection.html">many down­side risks</a>, but the up­side is large and the down­sides can be greatly alle­vi­ated.</p>

2024-10-13 04:02:47,404 - system - INFO - Response JSON: {'summary': "The article discusses strategies to enhance human intelligence in light of impending advancements in artificial general intelligence (AGI). It emphasizes the need for humans who can navigate AGI development, advocating for the creation of individuals with cognitive capabilities significantly above the average, positing a target of seven standard deviations above the mean. Various methods for achieving this goal are proposed, including germline engineering, adult gene editing, brain emulation, and brain-computer interfaces. Each method comes with its own set of challenges, such as ethical concerns, technical difficulties, and societal implications. The article also mentions constraints like Algernon's law, which suggests that any changes to human cognition must not decrease relative genetic fitness. Additionally, interdisciplinary collaboration and funding are encouraged for those interested in fields related to intelligence enhancement. There is a cautionary note regarding the potential risks associated with powerful intelligence amplification mechanisms and the need for careful consideration of the outcomes, as the implications on humanity and future AGI development could be profound. Ultimately, the text advocates for robust inquiry and action to create a generation of highly capable problem-solvers."}
