2024-10-23 04:01:39,368 - system - INFO - Response JSON: {'summary': "Labour activists in the United States are facing allegations of making illegal 'contributions' to the presidential election due to their involvement as volunteers. A formal complaint has been filed asserting that the activities of these activists exceed permissible limits set by election laws, classifying their efforts as contributions rather than mere volunteerism. The complaint highlights concerns about the role of organized labor in the electoral process, suggesting that when activists campaign on behalf of candidates, their volunteer efforts may inadvertently violate legal restrictions on contributions from unions. The case raises important questions regarding the intersection of labor rights, volunteerism, and electoral regulations, with implications for how similar future activities may be viewed under the law. Supporters of the activists argue that their engagement is a form of free expression and civic participation, while critics contend that without proper oversight, such acts could undermine the integrity of the electoral process. This ongoing dispute showcases the complexities within U.S. campaign finance law and the continuing debate about the influence of organized labor in politics."}

<p>Of all the cog­ni­tive tools our an­ces­tors left us, what’s best? So­ciety seems to think pretty highly of ar­ith­metic. It’s one of the first things we learn as chil­dren. So I think it’s weird that only a tiny per­centage of peo­ple seem to know how to ac­tu­ally <i>use</i> ar­ith­metic. Or maybe even un­der­stand what ar­ith­metic is for. Why?</p><p>I think the prob­lem is the idea that ar­ith­metic is about “calcu­lat­ing”. No! Arith­metic is a world-mod­el­ing tech­nol­ogy. Ar­guably, it’s the <i>best</i> world-mod­el­ing tech­nol­ogy: It’s sim­ple, it’s in­tu­itive, and it ap­plies to ev­ery­thing. It al­lows you to tres­pass into sci­en­tific do­mains where you don’t be­long. It even has an amaz­ing er­ror-catch­ing mechanism built in.</p><p>One hun­dred years ago, maybe it was im­por­tant to learn long di­vi­sion. But the <i>point</i> of long di­vi­sion was to en­able you to do world-mod­el­ing. Com­put­ers don’t make ar­ith­metic ob­so­lete. If any­thing, they do the op­po­site. Without ar­ith­metic, you sim­ply can’t ac­cess a huge frac­tion of the most im­por­tant facts about the world.</p><p>The magic lives in a thing called “units”.</p><h2>Chimps</h2><p>It’s amaz­ing how much we don’t know about nu­tri­tion. For ex­am­ple, would you live longer if you ate less salt? How much longer? We can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac208">guess</a>, but we don’t re­ally know.</p><p>To re­ally be sure, we’d need to take two groups of peo­ple, get them to eat differ­ent amounts of salt, and then see how long they live. This is ex­pen­sive, eth­i­cally fraught, and runs into the prob­lem that when you tell peo­ple to eat differ­ently, they usu­ally ig­nore you.</p><p>So I’ve of­ten won­dered: Why don’t we do these ex­per­i­ments on <i>an­i­mals</i>? Why not get two big groups of chim­panzees, and feed them differ­ent amounts of salt? Chimps aren’t peo­ple, but it would tell us some­thing, right?</p><p>Why don’t we do this? Be­cause ar­ith­metic.</p><p>How much would such a study cost? To figure this out, you will need three num­bers:</p><ol><li><p>The av­er­age lifes­pan of a chimp.</p></li><li><p>The cost to main­tain one chimp in a re­search fa­cil­ity for one day.</p></li><li><p>The num­ber of chimps you’d need for a study.</p></li></ol><p>Let’s do these. First, how long do chimps live? In cap­tivity the av­er­age seems to be around 36.3 years. (In­ci­den­tally, fe­male chimps seem to live 25% longer than males—imag­ine hu­man women lived un­til 90 while men died at 71.)</p><p>Se­cond, how much does it cost to main­tain a chimp? <a href="https://www.releasechimps.org/photos-and-pics/Economics%20%20Chimp%20Research_T%20%20Capaldo%20et%20al%20revised%20for%20website.pdf">Ca­paldo et al.</a> looked at the av­er­age costs in var­i­ous re­search fa­cil­ities in the US in 2009. They es­ti­mate around $75/​day (in 2024 dol­lars).</p><p>Fi­nally, how many chimps do you need? To calcu­late this, you should do a “power calcu­la­tion”—you guess how much life ex­pec­tancy varies due to (a) salt and (b) all ran­dom fac­tors, and work back­wards to see how many chimps you need to sep­a­rate the sig­nal from the noise. There are lots of <a href="https://clincalc.com/stats/samplesize.aspx">calcu­la­tors</a> for this. If you as­sume chimps live 36.3±8 years and salt would change life ex­pec­tancy by 2 years, these will tell you that you need 502 chimps.</p><p>So now we can do our calcu­la­tion:</p><p>  502 chimps<br />     × 36.3 years<br />     × 365.25 days /​ year<br />     × 75 dol­lars /​ (chimp day)<br />     ≈ 499,185,349 dollars</p><p>No­tice three things.</p><p>First, 500 mil­lion dol­lars is a <i>lot</i>. That’s five times what the <a href="https://dynomight.net/alcohol-trial/">big al­co­hol trial</a> would have cost. It’s a gi­gan­tic amount of money for some­thing that would only give in­di­rect ev­i­dence for the im­pact of salt in hu­mans, and wouldn’t even do that un­til decades in the fu­ture.</p><p>Se­cond, no­tice how I kept the units. Always keep units! On the “top” of the calcu­la­tion, the units were “chimps × years × days × dol­lars”. On the “bot­tom”, the units were “years × chimps × days”. When you can­cel terms, you’re left with dol­lars only. Units are great be­cause if you made a mis­take, it will prob­a­bly show up in the units not work­ing out. We’ll see other benefits be­low. So: ALWAYS KEEP UNITS.</p><p>(If you think you’re an ex­cep­tion and you don’t need units, then you <i>es­pe­cially</i> need to keep units.)</p><p>Fi­nally, no­tice that this calcu­la­tion didn’t just tell us how ex­pen­sive the study would be. It also points to­wards <i>why</i> it’s so ex­pen­sive, and what would be needed to make it cheaper.</p><p>One op­tion would be to try to get away with fewer chimps. The rea­son so many are needed is be­cause the likely im­pact of salt is pretty small com­pared to nat­u­ral vari­a­tion in life ex­pec­tancy. You might be able to re­duce that nat­u­ral vari­a­tion by, for ex­am­ple, us­ing pairs of chimp twins to elimi­nate ge­netic vari­a­tion. If that re­duced the stan­dard de­vi­a­tion from 8 years to 5 years, then you’d only need 196 chimps and the to­tal cost would be “only” 195 mil­lion dol­lars. Sounds nice, though I imag­ine that cre­at­ing 98 chimp twins wouldn’t be free.</p><p>Another op­tion would be to re­duce the cost of main­tain­ing chimps. Doesn’t $75 per chimp per day seem <i>very</i> ex­pen­sive? Per­haps you could find a way to use ex­ist­ing chimps in zoos? Or you could use dogs in­stead of chimps and offer dog own­ers sub­si­dized dog chow with slightly vary­ing salt lev­els? Or you could built a gi­gan­tic out­door fa­cil­ity with 50,000 chimps where you could amor­tize costs by run­ning 100 ex­per­i­ments in par­allel?</p><p>I’m not sure which (if any) of these op­tions would work. My point is that do­ing the ar­ith­metic quickly takes you into speci­fics about what would be nec­es­sary to ac­tu­ally move the nee­dle. Without do­ing the ar­ith­metic, what chance would you have to say any­thing mean­ingful?</p><h2>Big blocks</h2><p>If I know my read­ers then at some point in your life you prob­a­bly con­sid­ered us­ing grav­ity to store en­ergy. Maybe you can put so­lar pan­els on your roof, but in­stead of stor­ing their en­ergy in bat­ter­ies, you can just lift up a gi­ant block into the air. At night you can slowly let the block down to power your house. How big a block do you need?</p><p>Let’s as­sume you don’t know much physics.</p><p>To an­swer this ques­tion, you’ll need two num­bers:</p><ol><li><p>How much en­ergy do you need to store to power your house?</p></li><li><p>How much en­ergy can you store by lift­ing up a gi­ant block?</p></li></ol><p>If you check the in­ter­net, you’ll learn that the av­er­age US house­hold uses around 30 kWh of en­ergy per day. Now, what’s a “kWh”? To you, per­son who doesn’t know much physics, it looks scary, but ap­par­ently it’s some kind of unit of en­ergy, so let’s just write it down. As­sume you need to store half your daily en­ergy for us­age at night, or 15 kWh.</p><p>Now, how much en­ergy can you store by lift­ing a gi­ant block up into the air? A lit­tle bit of search­ing re­veals that “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#Overview">po­ten­tial en­ergy</a>” is the product of mass, grav­ity, and height: If you lift a block of weight <i>MASS</i> up to height <i>HEIGHT</i>, the stored en­ergy is <i>U=MASS × g × HEIGHT</i> where <i>g ≈ 9.8 m/​s²</i> on Earth. Your house is 6m tall, and you reckon that’s as high as you could lift a block, so you use <i>h</i> = 6m. Thus, the amount of en­ergy you can store is</p><p>  <i>MASS × (9.8 m/​s²) × 6 m</i>.</p><p>What now? Now, you’re done! You just equate the en­ergy you need to store with the en­ergy you can store with a block that weighs <i>MASS</i>:</p><p>  15 kWh = <i>MASS</i> × (9.8 m/​s²) × 6 m.</p><p>Is this fright­en­ing? There are units ev­ery­where. You never figured out what a kWh is. How is that re­lated to me­ters and sec­onds? What does it mean to square a sec­ond? Panic!</p><p>Re­lax. We have com­put­ers. You can just me­chan­i­cally solve the above the above equa­tion to get <i>MASS</i> = 15 kWh /​ (9.8 m/​s² × 6 m) and then <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=15+kWh+%2F+(+9.8+m%2Fs^2+*+6+m)"><i>liter­ally type that into a search en­g­ine</i></a> to find that <i>MASS</i> is:</p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r2LojHBs3kriafZWi/tp4qw0vhqe9ajitils7a" /></figure><p>Look at that—the an­swer is in kilo­grams!</p><p>It hap­pens to be the case that 1 kWh = 3,600,000 kg m²/​s². You <i>could</i> sub­sti­tute this and can­cel units to get the same an­swer. But don’t. At­tempt­ing that just gives you the chance to screw things up. Why com­pli­cate your life?</p><p>And as be­fore, the units give you a sort of “type check­ing”. If your calcu­la­tion was wrong, you’d have to be very un­lucky to get an an­swer that was in kg any­way.</p><p>Here the units did most of the work for you. So it’s a good thing you kept units.</p><p><strong>ALWAYS KEEP UNITS</strong>.</p><h2>More big blocks</h2><p>So, a 918 thou­sand kg block. How much would that cost? It seems nat­u­ral to use rock, but it’s hard to get mil­lion kilo­gram boulders de­liv­ered to your house these days. So let’s use steel. Cur­rent steel prices are $350/​ton. So we want to solve</p><p>  <i>918,367 kg = MONEY × 1 ton /​ $350</i>.</p><p>How are tons re­lated to kilo­grams? Say it with me: <i>Not your prob­lem</i>. Just solve the above equa­tion for <i>MONEY</i> and ask the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=918367+kg+%2F+%281+ton+%2F+%24350%29">big com­puter</a> to learn that <i>MONEY</i> is</p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r2LojHBs3kriafZWi/ziypldfkuiyyictborbe" /></figure><p>That’s 65× more than just buy­ing a 20 kWh home bat­tery. But let’s say you’re com­mit­ted to the bit. How <i>big</i> would that block be? Some search­ing re­veals that the den­sity of steel is around 7.85 g/​cm³. So if you have a cu­bic block of vol­ume VOLUME, then</p><p>  <i>MASS = 7.85 g /​ cm³ × VOLUME</i>.</p><p>Solv­ing for <i>VOLUME</i>, us­ing the pre­vi­ous value for <i>MASS</i>, and not stress­ing about units, you can <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=918367+kg+%2F+(7.85+g+%2F+cm^3)+in+m^3">eas­ily find</a> that <i>VOLUME</i> is</p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r2LojHBs3kriafZWi/mlrszpmbq1kptc1fbtov" /></figure><p>A 117 cu­bic me­ter block is around 4.9 me­ters on all sides. So, roughly speak­ing, your house will look some­thing like this:</p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r2LojHBs3kriafZWi/y5jwbpdin15hycx8shgd" /></figure><p>As it hap­pens, 1 mil­lion kg cranes <i>do</i> ex­ist. But even used, they’ll set you back an­other mil­lion dol­lars or so. If you’re go­ing to get one of those, then may I sug­gest that the same weight is given by al­most ex­actly 4.5 Stat­ues of Liberty? So I sug­gest you also con­sider this op­tion (drawn to scale):</p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r2LojHBs3kriafZWi/iwkhc4rvkbulwd5v0d91" /></figure><p>Either way, your neigh­bors will love it.</p>
