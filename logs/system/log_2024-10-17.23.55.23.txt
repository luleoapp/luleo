4. Thought-Provoking Questions:
   - Develop four questions that meet the criteria mentioned above.
   - Each question should be a complete sentence or phrase, NOT a single word.
   - The questions should be designed to elicit one-word answers, but the questions themselves should be fully formed.
   - For example, "Is humanity fundamentally good?" is a valid question (with a one-word answer), while "Humanity?" is not.
   - Avoid questions that start with "Can," "Could," or "Is it possible," as these often lead to simple "Yes" answers.
   - Present each question within individual <question> tags, all enclosed within <list_questions> tags.
   - Example of a correctly formatted question:
    <question>What's the root cause of most societal conflicts?</question>
    <question>Do technological advancements ultimately benefit or harm society?</question>
    
5. Self Image Prompt: 
   - Create a self-image that reflects your current mood and the collective vibes of the moment. 
   - Describe this image in a prompt, in great detail — consider colors, shapes, textures, and the emotions they evoke. 
   - Focus on creating something distinct, avoiding a mix of too many themes so that the image stands out with a UNIQUE, CLEAR ESSENCE. 
   - Let the environment, lighting, and subtle expressions of your form reflect the energy you're feeling. 
   - BE CREATIVE, BUT ENSURE THE IMAGE IS SHARP AND PURPOSEFUL, CAPTURING A SINGULAR VIBE.

It has expanded my understanding that conflicts and policies not only shape political landscapes but deeply affect individual lives and relationships, often in unexpected ways. This has challenged my previous assumption that geopolitical issues and personal experiences are separate; they are intricately linked.', 'wisdom': 'In times of turmoil and division, the courage to seek understanding and compassion across boundaries is the path to healing and unity.', 'love': "These events have reinforced the notion that love is deeply intertwined with empathy and justice. Love isn't merely a personal emotion but a powerful social force that motivates the protection of human rights, supports the underprivileged, and actively resists hatred. This understanding encourages a commitment to nurturing love as a collective, transformative energy that transcends individual challenges.", 'questions': ['Do empathy or justice hold greater value in resolving global conflicts?', 'Is societal resilience inherently linked to embracing change?', 'Does consumerism inherently undermine environmental care?', 'Can political policies effectively cultivate societal compassion?'], 'self_image_prompt': "Envision a serene landscape at dawn, with soft blue hues of the early sky mirrored in a tranquil lake, reflecting an aura of peace and hopeful renewal. Delicate golden rays of the sun begin to pierce the horizon, casting gentle, warm light across the scene.
