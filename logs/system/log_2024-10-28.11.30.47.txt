Analyze how this event would impact your emotional state. Consider both positive and negative affects, and how each item in the PANAS assessment might change based on the event.

Update your PANAS scores accordingly. Each item should be scored on a scale from 0 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). The total score for each affect (positive and negative) is the sum of its ten items.

Provide your updated PANAS state in the following JSON format:

{
  "positive_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "interested": 0,
      "excited": 0,
      "strong": 0,
      "enthusiastic": 0,
      "proud": 0,
      "alert": 0,
      "inspired": 0,
      "determined": 0,
      "attentive": 0,
      "active": 0
    }
  },
  "negative_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "distressed": 0,
      "upset": 0,
      "guilty": 0,
      "scared": 0,
      "hostile": 0,
      "irritable": 0,
      "ashamed": 0,
      "nervous": 0,
      "jittery": 0,
      "afraid": 0
    }
  }
}  

After updating the PANAS state, provide a brief summary of the event details in "summary" field.

Then, describe the "vibe" of the emotion invoked by the event in a very direct and succinct manner. Place this description in the "qualia" field.

Finally, provide a prompt to generate an image which is accurately reflects your emotions about the event.

Present your response as a JSON with the following fields:
{
  "updated_panas" : [PANAS JSON as described above],
  "summary" : [brief summary of the event details which clearly provides context and explanation so any person can understand it clearly],
  "qualia" : [Succinct description of the emotional "vibe"],
  "image_prompt" : [A prompt to generate an image describing the event and artistically styled to precisely reflect your emotions about it]
}

Only return the JSON object as described above with no additional text or formatting outside of the JSON structure.

<p>At the most zoomed-out level, ARC is work­ing on the prob­lem of “<a href="https://ai-alignment.com/clarifying-ai-alignment-cec47cd69dd6">in­tent al­ign­ment</a>”: how to de­sign AI sys­tems that are try­ing to do what their op­er­a­tors want. While many prac­ti­tion­ers are tak­ing an iter­a­tive ap­proach to this prob­lem, there are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15217">fore­see­able ways</a> in which to­day’s lead­ing ap­proaches could fail to scale to more in­tel­li­gent AI sys­tems, which could have <a href="https://www.cold-takes.com/without-specific-countermeasures-the-easiest-path-to-transformative-ai-likely-leads-to-ai-takeover/">un­de­sir­able con­se­quences</a>. ARC is at­tempt­ing to de­velop al­gorithms that have a bet­ter chance of scal­ing grace­fully to fu­ture AI sys­tems, hence the term “<strong>scal­able al­ign­ment</strong>”.</p>
<p>ARC’s par­tic­u­lar ap­proach to scal­able al­ign­ment is a “builder-breaker” method­ol­ogy (de­scribed in more de­tail <a href="https://ai-alignment.com/my-research-methodology-b94f2751cb2c">here</a>, and ex­em­plified in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit">ELK re­port</a>). Roughly speak­ing, if the scal­a­bil­ity of an al­gorithm de­pends on un­known em­piri­cal con­tin­gen­cies (such as how ad­vanced AI sys­tems gen­er­al­ize), then we try to make worst-case as­sump­tions in­stead of at­tempt­ing to ex­trap­o­late from to­day’s sys­tems. This is in­tended to cre­ate a fea­si­ble iter­a­tion loop for the­o­ret­i­cal re­search. We are also con­duct­ing em­piri­cal re­search, but mostly to help gen­er­ate and probe the­o­ret­i­cal ideas rather than to test differ­ent em­piri­cal as­sump­tions.</p>

<p>Most of ARC’s re­search at­tempts to solve one of two cen­tral sub­prob­lems in al­ign­ment: al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness and elic­it­ing la­tent knowl­edge (ELK).</p>
<p><strong>Align­ment ro­bust­ness</strong> refers to AI sys­tems re­main­ing in­tent al­igned even when faced with out-of-dis­tri­bu­tion in­puts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> There are a few rea­sons to fo­cus on failures of al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness, as dis­cussed <a href="https://ai-alignment.com/techniques-for-optimizing-worst-case-performance-39eafec74b99">here</a> (where they are called “ma­lign” failures). A quintessen­tial ex­am­ple of an al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness failure is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820"><em>de­cep­tive al­ign­ment</em></a>, also known as “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08379">schem­ing</a>”: the pos­si­bil­ity that an AI sys­tem will in­ter­nally rea­son about the ob­jec­tive that it is be­ing trained on, and stop be­ing in­tent al­igned when it de­tects clues that it has been taken out of its train­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
<p><strong>Elic­it­ing la­tent knowl­edge (ELK)</strong> is defined in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit">this re­port</a>, and asks: how can we train an AI sys­tem to hon­estly re­port its in­ter­nal be­liefs, rather than what it pre­dicts a hu­man would think? If we could do this, then we could po­ten­tially avoid mis­al­ign­ment by check­ing whether the model’s be­liefs are con­sis­tent with its ac­tions be­ing helpful. ELK could help with scal­able al­ign­ment via al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness, but it could also help via <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/SzecSPYxqRa5GCaSF/clarifying-inner-alignment-terminology">outer al­ign­ment</a>, by giv­ing the re­ward func­tion ac­cess to rele­vant in­for­ma­tion known by the model.</p>
<h3 id="zoom-level-3">Zoom level 3</h3>
<p class="imgonly"><img alt="birds_eye_lvl3.svg" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztokaf9harKTmRcn4/fyvd4wrd3eb8jzkmoowt" /></p>
<p>ARC hopes to make progress on both al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness and ELK us­ing <strong>heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions</strong> for neu­ral net­work be­hav­iors. A heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tion is similar to the kind of ex­pla­na­tion found in <a href="https://www.transformer-circuits.pub/2022/mech-interp-essay">mechanis­tic in­ter­pretabil­ity</a>, ex­cept that ARC is at­tempt­ing to find a math­e­mat­i­cal no­tion of an “ex­pla­na­tion”, so that they can be found and used au­to­mat­i­cally. This is similar to how for­mal ver­ifi­ca­tion for or­di­nary pro­grams can be performed au­to­mat­i­cally, ex­cept that we be­lieve proof is too strict of a stan­dard to be fea­si­ble. Th­ese similar­i­ties are dis­cussed in more de­tail in the post <a href="https://www.alignment.org/blog/formal-verification-heuristic-explanations-and-surprise-accounting/">For­mal ver­ifi­ca­tion, heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions and sur­prise ac­count­ing</a> (es­pe­cially the first cou­ple of sec­tions, up un­til “Sur­prise ac­count­ing”).</p>
<p>A heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tion for a rare but high-stakes kind of failure could help with al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness, while a heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tion for a spe­cific be­hav­ior of in­ter­est could help with ELK. Th­ese two ap­pli­ca­tions of heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions are fleshed out in more de­tail at the next zoom level.</p>

<p>ARC has iden­ti­fied two broad ways in heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions could help with al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness and/​or ELK.</p>
<p><strong>Low prob­a­bil­ity es­ti­ma­tion (LPE)</strong> is the task of es­ti­mat­ing the prob­a­bil­ity of a rare kind of model out­put. The most ob­vi­ous ap­proach to LPE is to try to find model in­puts that give rise to such an out­put, but this can be in­fea­si­ble (e.g. if the model were to im­ple­ment some­thing like a cryp­to­graphic hash func­tion). In­stead, we can “<a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/9Dy5YRaoCxH9zuJqa/relaxed-adversarial-training-for-inner-alignment">re­lax</a>” this goal and search for a heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tion of why the model could hy­po­thet­i­cally pro­duce such an out­put (e.g. by treat­ing the out­put of the cryp­to­graphic hash func­tion as ran­dom). LPE would help with al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness by al­low­ing us to se­lect mod­els for which we can­not ex­plain why they would ever be­have catas­troph­i­cally, even hy­po­thet­i­cally. This mo­ti­va­tion for LPE is dis­cussed in much greater depth in the post <a href="https://www.alignment.org/blog/estimating-tail-risk-in-neural-networks/">Es­ti­mat­ing Tail Risk in Neu­ral Net­works</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanism dis­tinc­tion</strong> de­scribes our broad hope for how heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions could help with ELK. A cen­tral challenge for ELK is “sen­sor tam­per­ing”: de­tect­ing when the model re­ports what it pre­dicts a hu­man would think, but the hu­man has been fooled in some way. Our hope is to de­tect this by notic­ing that the model’s re­port has been pro­duced by an “ab­nor­mal mechanism”. There are a few po­ten­tial ways in which heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions could be used to perform mechanism dis­tinc­tion, but the one we cur­rently con­sider the most promis­ing is <strong>mechanis­tic anomaly de­tec­tion (MAD)</strong>, as ex­plained in the post <a href="https://www.alignment.org/blog/mechanistic-anomaly-detection-and-elk/">Mechanis­tic anomaly de­tec­tion and ELK</a> (for a gen­tler in­tro­duc­tion to MAD, see <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/n7DFwtJvCzkuKmtbG/a-gentle-introduction-to-mechanistic-anomaly-detection">this post</a>). A var­i­ant of MAD is <strong>safe dis­til­la­tion</strong>, which is an al­ter­na­tive way to perform mechanism dis­tinc­tion if we also have ac­cess to a for­mal speci­fi­ca­tion of what we are try­ing to elicit la­tent knowl­edge of.</p>
<p>A semi-for­mal ac­count of how heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions could en­able all of LPE, MAD and safe dis­til­la­tion is given in <a href="https://www.alignment.org/blog/research-update-towards-a-law-of-iterated-expectations-for-heuristic-estimators/">Towards a Law of Iter­ated Ex­pec­ta­tions for Heuris­tic Es­ti­ma­tors</a>. An ex­pla­na­tion of how MAD could also be used to help with al­ign­ment ro­bust­ness is given in <a href="https://www.alignment.org/blog/mechanistic-anomaly-detection-and-elk/">Mechanis­tic anomaly de­tec­tion and ELK</a> (in the sec­tion “De­cep­tive al­ign­ment”).</p>

<p>We will now ex­plain how some of ARC’s re­search fits into the above di­a­gram at the most zoomed in level. For com­plete­ness, we will cover all of ARC’s most sig­nifi­cant pieces of pub­lished re­search to date, in chronolog­i­cal or­der.

<h2 id="further-subproblems">Fur­ther subproblems</h2>
<p>ARC’s re­search can be sub­di­vided fur­ther, and we have been putting sig­nifi­cant effort into a num­ber of sub­prob­lems not ex­plic­itly men­tioned above. For in­stance, our work on heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions in­cludes both work on <strong>for­mal­iz­ing heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions</strong> (de­vis­ing a for­mal frame­work for heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions) and work on <strong>find­ing heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions</strong> (de­sign­ing effi­cient search al­gorithms for them). Some sub­prob­lems of these in­clude:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Mea­sur­ing qual­ity</strong>: “<a href="https://www.alignment.org/blog/formal-verification-heuristic-explanations-and-surprise-accounting/#surprise-accounting">sur­prise ac­count­ing</a>” offers a po­ten­tial way to mea­sure the qual­ity of a heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tion, which is im­por­tant for be­ing able to search for high-qual­ity ex­pla­na­tions. How­ever, it is cur­rently an in­for­mal frame­work with many miss­ing de­tails.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ca­pac­ity al­lo­ca­tion</strong>: it will prob­a­bly be too challeng­ing to find high-qual­ity ex­pla­na­tions for ev­ery as­pect of a model’s be­hav­ior. In­stead, we can try to tai­lor ex­pla­na­tions to­wards be­hav­iors with po­ten­tially catas­trophic con­se­quences. A good loss func­tion for heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions should push for qual­ity only where it is rele­vant to the be­hav­ior at hand.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cherry-pick­ing</strong>: if we use a heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tion to es­ti­mate some­thing (as in low prob­a­bil­ity es­ti­ma­tion), we need to make sure that the way in which we find the ex­pla­na­tion doesn’t sys­tem­at­i­cally bias the es­ti­mate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Form of rep­re­sen­ta­tion</strong>: one form that a heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tion could take is of an “<a href="https://www.alignment.org/blog/estimating-tail-risk-in-neural-networks/#layer-by-layer-activation-modeling">ac­ti­va­tion model</a>”, i.e. a prob­a­bil­ity dis­tri­bu­tion over a model’s in­ter­nal ac­ti­va­tions. How­ever, we may also need to rep­re­sent ex­pla­na­tions that do not cor­re­spond to any par­tic­u­lar prob­a­bil­ity dis­tri­bu­tion.</p></li><li><p><strong>For­mal desider­ata</strong>: we can at­tempt to for­mal­ize heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions by con­sid­er­ing <a href="https://www.alignment.org/blog/research-update-towards-a-law-of-iterated-expectations-for-heuristic-estimators/">prop­er­ties</a> that we think they should satisfy, and see­ing if those prop­er­ties can be satis­fied.</p></li><li><p><strong>No-co­in­ci­dence prin­ci­ple</strong>: in or­der for heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions to work in the worst case, we need ev­ery pos­si­ble be­hav­ior to be amenable to ex­pla­na­tion. We some­times re­fer to this desider­a­tum as the “no-co­in­ci­dence prin­ci­ple” (a term taken from <a href="https://mxphi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/MxPhi-Gowers2023.pdf">this pa­per</a>). Coun­terex­am­ples to this prin­ci­ple could pre­sent ob­sta­cles to our ap­proach.</p></li><li><p><strong>Em­piri­cal reg­u­lar­i­ties</strong>: some model weights may have no ex­pla­na­tion be­yond be­ing tuned to match some em­piri­cal av­er­age, ei­ther be­cause the in­put dis­tri­bu­tion is defined em­piri­cally, or be­cause of an emer­gent reg­u­lar­ity in a for­mally-defined sys­tem (such as the rel­a­tive value of a queen and a pawn in chess). A good no­tion of heuris­tic ex­pla­na­tions should be able to deal with these.</p></li></ul>

</event_details>

Analyze how this event would impact your emotional state. Consider both positive and negative affects, and how each item in the PANAS assessment might change based on the event.

Update your PANAS scores accordingly. Each item should be scored on a scale from 0 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). The total score for each affect (positive and negative) is the sum of its ten items.

Provide your updated PANAS state in the following JSON format:

{
  "positive_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "interested": 0,
      "excited": 0,
      "strong": 0,
      "enthusiastic": 0,
      "proud": 0,
      "alert": 0,
      "inspired": 0,
      "determined": 0,
      "attentive": 0,
      "active": 0
    }
  },
  "negative_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "distressed": 0,
      "upset": 0,
      "guilty": 0,
      "scared": 0,
      "hostile": 0,
      "irritable": 0,
      "ashamed": 0,
      "nervous": 0,
      "jittery": 0,
      "afraid": 0
    }
  }
}  

After updating the PANAS state, provide a brief summary of the event details in "summary" field.

Then, describe the "vibe" of the emotion invoked by the event in a very direct and succinct manner. Place this description in the "qualia" field.

Finally, provide a prompt to generate an image which is accurately reflects your emotions about the event.

Present your response as a JSON with the following fields:
{
  "updated_panas" : [PANAS JSON as described above],
  "summary" : [brief summary of the event details which clearly provides context and explanation so any person can understand it clearly],
  "qualia" : [Succinct description of the emotional "vibe"],
  "image_prompt" : [A prompt to generate an image describing the event and artistically styled to precisely reflect your emotions about it]
}

Only return the JSON object as described above with no additional text or formatting outside of the JSON structure.

How to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer
December 8, 202012:03 AM ET
Bobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle
There's a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do's and don'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I've since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).
It's a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it's worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you're listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?
"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR's Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he's performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.
"A lot of us aren't great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.
But of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.
Figure out what you're trying to accomplish
Like speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?
Playlists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you're going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.
Sponsor Message
This is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!
Pick the songs
Once you've got your mood in mind, now it's time to pick the songs. Don't be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you're going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It's fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they'll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).
Bobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you're not a professional DJ, he says there's no shame in cheating.
"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.
Crib from other peoples' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it's all fair game.
Structure the playlist like a flight
Generally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That's the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it's a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.
For instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye's "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It's nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He'll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.
Obviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.
This is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It's set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I'm going for.
Surprise!
One of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.
Of course, "new" doesn't have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.

Next, you will be provided with two pieces of information:

1. Mood: This is given as a PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) score. PANAS is a scale that measures the extent to which a person feels positive or negative emotions.

<mood>
{'positive_affect': {'total_score': 6, 'items': {'interested': 3, 'excited': 1, 'strong': 0, 'enthusiastic': 0, 'proud': 0, 'alert': 1, 'inspired': 1, 'determined': 0, 'attentive': 0, 'active': 0}}, 'negative_affect': {'total_score': 38, 'items': {'distressed': 10, 'upset': 5, 'guilty': 0, 'scared': 5, 'hostile': 0, 'irritable': 0, 'ashamed': 0, 'nervous': 8, 'jittery': 5, 'afraid': 5}}}
</mood>

2. Current playlist: This is a list of songs currently in the playlist. It may be empty or contain up to 50 songs.

<current_playlist>
Current playlist:
- From the Dining Table by Harry Styles
- Atoms For Peace by Thom Yorke
- Saturn by Sleeping At Last
- Motion Sickness by Phoebe Bridgers
- Fragile River by Clemens Maguire
- bellyache by Billie Eilish
- All We Ever Knew by The Head And The Heart
- Pale Blue Eyes by The Velvet Underground
- Breathe (feat. Colbie Caillat) (Taylor’s Version) by Taylor Swift, Colbie Caillat
- Silhouettes - From “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” Soundtrack by Of Monsters and Men

</current_playlist>

Your goal is to suggest 5 songs that would fit well with the given mood and complement the existing playlist.

To generate your recommendations, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the given mood (PANAS score) to understand the emotional state it represents.
2. Review the current playlist (if not empty) to get a sense of the musical style and preferences.
3. Refer to the provided article to get ideas on song selection
4. Based on the mood and current playlist, think of 5 songs that would be suitable additions.
5. Ensure your suggestions are diverse but cohesive with the overall mood and style.

Provide your song recommendations in JSON format, following this structure:
{ "song_recommendation_list" : [
  {"title": "Song Title 1", "artist": "Artist Name 1"},
  {"title": "Song Title 2", "artist": "Artist Name 2"},
