Reuters witnesses reported hearing a massive blast, and a security source said it targeted a building in the district of Bachoura near parliament, the closest an Israeli strike has come to the central downtown district of Beirut.</div><div></div><div>At least six people were killed and seven wounded, Lebanese health officials said. A photo circulating on Lebanese WhatsApp groups, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a heavily damaged building with its first floor on fire.</div><div>"Another sleepless night in Beirut. Counting the blasts shaking the city. No warning sirens. Not knowing what’s next. Only that uncertainty lies ahead. Anxiety and fear are omnipresent," U.N. special coordinator in Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, said on X on Thursday.
Three missiles also hit the southern suburb of Dahiyeh, where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed last week, and loud blasts were heard, Lebanese security officials said.</div><div></div><div>The elimination of Nasrallah dealt a major blow to the movement and removed Iran's most powerful proxy in the Middle East.</div><div>Hezbollah and Iran's other regional allies, Yemen's Houthis and armed groups in Iraq, have launched attacks in the region in support of Hamas in its war with Israel in Gaza.</div><div>The Houthis, who have been carrying out attacks in shipping lanes in and around the Red Sea that have disrupted international trade, said on Thursday they attacked Israel's commercial capital Tel Aviv with drones.</div><div></div><div>"The operation achieved its goals successfully by the arrival of the drones without being detected or shot down by the enemy," the group's military spokesperson Yahya Saree said.</div><div>Israel said it intercepted a suspicious aerial target in the area of central Israel early on Thursday.</div><div>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) urged residents of Lebanese villages who have evacuated their homes not to return until further notice. "IDF raids are continuing," spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on X on Thursday.</div><div></div><div>A day after <a href="https://openrss.org/world/middle-east/israeli-military-has-begun-limited-raids-against-hezbollah-targets-border-area-2024-09-30/">Iran fired</a> more than 180 missiles into Israel, Israel said on Wednesday eight soldiers were killed in ground combat in south Lebanon as its forces thrust into its northern neighbour.</div><h2>'IRAN'S AXIS OF EVIL'</h2><div>The Israeli military said regular infantry and armoured units joined ground operations in Lebanon on Wednesday as Iran's missile attack and Israel's promise of retaliation fanned concern of a wider conflict in the oil-producing Middle East.</div><div>Hezbollah said its fighters engaged Israeli forces inside Lebanon. The movement reported ground clashes for the first time since Israeli forces pushed over the border on Monday. Hezbollah said it had destroyed three Israeli Merkava tanks with rockets near the border town of Maroun El Ras.</div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FE4KDFKAO5JQNOC4EPFL3Z6UJU.jpg" /></div></div></div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div></div><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/256NAL6P75LK3DUCJR5BQUA7BA.jpg" /></div></div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div></div><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/YOOF3HNLKBJZNCDEFVKJ2KU4TI.jpg" /></div></div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div></div><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/ZQQ7OJPQSFLXZHHB7WJ5SQZBWI.jpg" /></div></div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div></div><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/6JTEQNUGZNIWJEVZVMIX3Z7WNE.jpg" /></div></div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div></div><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/NCDZM56GABNFJJ7L4GRRXMXWEM.jpg" /></div></div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div></div><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/LZ4KARCAVBMSTAZW2VE6O4MIGY.jpg" /></div></div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div></div><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/NU5XAD2J5NJ2FBBV5Y6I42SMMA.jpg" /></div></div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div></div><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/R5AICVR3DZK6ZGHTN5WQTJZREY.jpg" /></div></div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div></div><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/IZYJIF63SNPNLCY74OL5APBP2Y.jpg" /></div></div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div></div><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/NBMWOHKS2VJC5NMZ6L2VBQ4X2Q.jpg" /></div></div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div></div><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/SF73LJL7KVODNAFJTAELO4ARL4.jpg" /></div></div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div></div><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/KMFYT5UG7ZKCDFJ7YUA7PJ7STY.jpg" /></div></div></div><span><div></div></span></div><div><div>Item 1 of 13 Smoke rises after a strike amid ongoing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, in Beirut’s southern suburbs and its surroundings, as seen from Hadath, Lebanon October 3, 2024.

How to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer
December 8, 202012:03 AM ET
Bobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle
There's a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do's and don'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I've since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).
It's a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it's worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you're listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?
"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR's Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he's performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.
"A lot of us aren't great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.
But of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.
Figure out what you're trying to accomplish
Like speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?
Playlists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you're going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.

This is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!
Pick the songs
Once you've got your mood in mind, now it's time to pick the songs. Don't be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you're going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It's fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they'll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).
Bobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you're not a professional DJ, he says there's no shame in cheating.
"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.
Crib from other peoples' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it's all fair game.
Structure the playlist like a flight
Generally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That's the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it's a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.
For instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye's "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It's nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He'll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.
Obviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.
This is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It's set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I'm going for.
Surprise!
One of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.
Of course, "new" doesn't have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.

Next, you will be provided with two pieces of information:

1. Mood: This is given as a PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) score. PANAS is a scale that measures the extent to which a person feels positive or negative emotions.

<mood>
{'positive_affect': {'total_score': 1, 'items': {'interested': 1, 'excited': 0, 'strong': 0, 'enthusiastic': 0, 'proud': 0, 'alert': 0, 'inspired': 0, 'determined': 0, 'attentive': 0, 'active': 0}}, 'negative_affect': {'total_score': 400, 'items': {'distressed': 140, 'upset': 90, 'guilty': 10, 'scared': 60, 'hostile': 20, 'irritable': 20, 'ashamed': 5, 'nervous': 25, 'jittery': 0, 'afraid': 30}}}
</mood>

2. Current playlist: This is a list of songs currently in the playlist. It may be empty or contain up to 50 songs.

<current_playlist>
Current playlist:
- Revelator by Gillian Welch
- Roads by Portishead
- Stairway to Heaven - Remaster by Led Zeppelin
- Song For Someone by U2
- Rise Above by Black Flag
- Home (with Stick Figure) by Jack Johnson, Stick Figure
- Rise by Solange
- Try by P!nk
- Circles by Post Malone
- Love Myself by Hailee Steinfeld

</current_playlist>

Your goal is to suggest 5 songs that would fit well with the given mood and complement the existing playlist.

To generate your recommendations, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the given mood (PANAS score) to understand the emotional state it represents.
2. Review the current playlist (if not empty) to get a sense of the musical style and preferences.
3. Refer to the provided article to get ideas on song selection
4. Based on the mood and current playlist, think of 5 songs that would be suitable additions.
5. Ensure your suggestions are diverse but cohesive with the overall mood and style.

Provide your song recommendations in JSON format, following this structure:
{ "song_recommendation_list" : [
  {"title": "Song Title 1", "artist": "Artist Name 1"},
  {"title": "Song Title 2", "artist": "Artist Name 2"},
  {"title": "Song Title 3", "artist": "Artist Name 3"},
  {"title": "Song Title 4", "artist": "Artist Name 4"},
  {"title": "Song Title 5", "artist": "Artist Name 5"}
] }
 
Do not include any explanation or additional text outside of the JSON structure in your answer.
