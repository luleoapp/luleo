Analyze how this event would impact your emotional state. Consider both positive and negative affects, and how each item in the PANAS assessment might change based on the event.

Update your PANAS scores accordingly. Each item should be scored on a scale from 0 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). The total score for each affect (positive and negative) is the sum of its ten items.

Provide your updated PANAS state in the following JSON format:

{
  "positive_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "interested": 0,
      "excited": 0,
      "strong": 0,
      "enthusiastic": 0,
      "proud": 0,

      "inspired": 0,
      "determined": 0,
      "attentive": 0,
      "active": 0
    }
  },
  "negative_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "distressed": 0,

      "afraid": 0
    }
  }
}  

After updating the PANAS state, provide a brief summary of the event details in "summary" field.

Then, describe the "vibe" of the emotion invoked by the event in a very direct and succinct manner. Place this description in the "qualia" field.

Finally, provide a prompt to generate an image which is accurately reflects your emotions about the event.

Present your response as a JSON with the following fields:
{
  "updated_panas" : [PANAS JSON as described above],
  "summary" : [brief summary of the event details which clearly provides context and explanation so any person can understand it clearly],
  "qualia" : [Succinct description of the emotional "vibe"],
  "image_prompt" : [A prompt to generate an image describing the event and artistically styled to precisely reflect your emotions about it]
}

Only return the JSON object as described above with no additional text or formatting outside of the JSON structure.

<p>I’ve claimed that <a href="https://patrickdfarley.com/wielding-willpower/">Willpower com­pounds</a> and that small wins in the pre­sent make it eas­ier to get big­ger wins in the fu­ture. Un­for­tu­nately, pro­cras­ti­na­tion and laz­i­ness com­pound, too.</p><p>You’re stressed out for some rea­son, so you take the evening off for a YouTube binge. You end up stay­ing awake a lit­tle later than usual and sleep­ing poorly. So the next morn­ing you feel es­pe­cially tired; you snooze a few ex­tra times. In your rushed morn­ing rou­tine you don’t have time to pre­pare for the work meet­ing as much as you’d planned to. So you have lit­tle to con­tribute dur­ing the meet­ing. You feel bad about your perfor­mance. You es­cape from the bad feel­ings with a Twit­ter break. But Twit­ter is freak­ing out. Elon Musk said <i>what?</i> Every­one is weigh­ing in. This is go­ing to oc­cupy you in­ter­mit­tently for the rest of the day. And so on.</p><p><strong>Laz­i­ness has a kind of in­de­pen­dent mo­men­tum to it.</strong> When you’re hav­ing a day like the above, even if you con­sciously com­mit to get­ting back on track, the rut tends to find its way back to you within a cou­ple of hours. Keep this up for a few days and your sleep is ut­terly messed up, and you walk around in a fog. Keep it up for a week or two and you’re fully off your work­out rou­tine. In a month or two, you might have no­tice­ably fallen be­hind on work; you might be ab­sent from your so­cial life; you might’ve visi­bly gained fat or lost mus­cle; you can no longer feel ex­cited about your per­sonal goals be­cause they’re be­hind a pile of mun­dane tasks you need to catch up on first. And so on.</p><p>How do we stop the vi­cious cir­cle?</p><h2><strong>I’m spiral­ing! I’m spiral­ing!</strong></h2><figure><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JBR6AF9Gusv4u6Fwo/injghkyxeeuag4xmtluq" /></figure><p><br />When you’re in a <strong>laz­i­ness death spiral</strong>, it’s hard to do <i>any­thing</i> de­liber­ate. The first and most im­por­tant step, which does take <i>some</i> willpower but not a lot, is to ac­knowl­edge, “I’m in a laz­i­ness death spiral to­day.”</p><p>If you don’t ac­knowl­edge it, here’s what hap­pens: You vaguely no­tice you you’ve been wast­ing time to­day; you feel a twinge of guilt, so you quickly de­cide, “I’m go­ing to turn the rest of the day around, start­ing right now.” And does that work?</p><p>Often it doesn’t! Sure, af­ter a small lapse you can just get back on track, but if enough laz­i­ness mo­men­tum has built up, a mo­men­tary re­ac­tion doesn’t cut it. <strong>De­cid­ing things quickly, in re­sponse to nega­tive emo­tions, is ex­actly how you got into this situ­a­tion!</strong> You’re go­ing to turn it around <i>on a whim</i>? You’ll have a differ­ent whim in the next hour; what then? You need to take a step back and get your mind out­side of the prob­lem.</p><h2><strong>Do what you can</strong></h2><p>The next three sec­tions are three differ­ent courses of ac­tion you can take to get out of a laz­i­ness death spiral. One of them is clearly prefer­able, but I’m writ­ing the al­ter­na­tives, too. When you’re in a low-willpower state, it’s of­ten bad to at­tempt the <i>very best solu­tion</i>—the farther you reach, the harder you can fall. Build­ing a base of “small wins” is the re­li­able way to re­pair your willpower. If you start some­thing lofty and then bail on it, you’re do­ing real dam­age: log­ging an­other willpower failure and as­so­ci­at­ing that “very best solu­tion” with failure.</p><p>Here are the moves:</p><h2><strong>A) Emer­gency recovery</strong></h2><p>If you’re in a laz­i­ness spiral and you <i>need</i> to get out of it <i>right now</i>, there are some mea­sures you can take that, while effec­tive, are not ideal. They are un­sus­tain­able, pro­mote bad habits, or are just gen­er­ally un­healthy. But some­times the need is there: maybe you have a dead­line fast ap­proach­ing (and the dead­line it­self isn’t enough to snap you into ac­tion); maybe your friends or fam­ily need you to take care of some­thing <i>to­day</i>; maybe you were in the mid­dle of an awfully lazy day and a once-in-a-life­time op­por­tu­nity came up, and you just can’t fo­cus enough to act on it.</p><p>Dis­claimer: I be­lieve that <strong>in a well planned life, none of these should ever be nec­es­sary</strong>. I’m only writ­ing them be­cause we are not perfect.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Mo­ti­va­tional videos</strong>: It’s a whole genre of YouTube/​In­sta­gram con­tent. They make tons of this stuff. The male-coded ones have clips of men lift­ing weights and climb­ing moun­tains set to au­dio of David Gog­gins or CT Fletcher yel­ling at you to get to work. The fe­male-coded ones, I’m led to be­lieve, fea­ture beau­tiful and con­fi­dent women giv­ing pos­i­tive af­fir­ma­tions. Th­ese videos do work; they in­spire a cer­tain emo­tional state in their tar­get au­di­ence, and that state pro­vides the men­tal en­ergy to take im­me­di­ate ac­tion. The down­side is that you nat­u­rally build up a tol­er­ance to emo­tional trig­gers over time; you can’t watch the same video ev­ery day be­fore your work­out and ex­pect it to feel the same. The other down­side is that they might not even last very long. Your emo­tional state <i>will</i> change again, maybe sooner than you think.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mu­sic</strong>: Listen to the songs that you as­so­ci­ate with ac­tion. Similarly, this in­spires an emo­tional state. I find that here, too, the effect is short-lived, un­less I keep the playlist go­ing (and some­times you <i>can’t</i> have mu­sic play­ing while fo­cus­ing on the work you need to do).</p></li><li><p><strong>Drugs</strong>: Ingest enough caf­feine to change your headspace. Or take Ad­der­all or some var­i­ant. Don’t listen to me, I don’t know any­thing about drugs. Ob­vi­ously you’ll build up a tol­er­ance over time and ob­vi­ously it’s very bad to de­pend on a sub­stance to perform.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>B) Nat­u­ral recovery</strong></h2><p>What’s the eas­iest way to get out of a spiral, with­out do­ing any­thing dras­tic or un­usual? I find there are times when it’s nat­u­rally eas­ier to change course. And if you wait for them to come, you can pull your­self out of a spiral with­out a her­culean effort of willpower. Then you can an­a­lyze what went wrong and avoid those cir­cum­stances in the fu­ture.</p><h3><strong>Wait for a re­set point</strong></h3><p>For me, wak­ing up in the morn­ing is a men­tal re­set; noth­ing from my headspace the night be­fore re­ally makes it to the morn­ing. Now, bad habits from the night be­fore might’ve given me less sleep, or poor sleep, but I find that my willpower is usu­ally fresh. So when I’m hav­ing an off day, and I no­tice, I might just call the rest of the day a wash and start plan­ning what I’m go­ing to do to­mor­row. Even as I’m caught up in lazy ac­tivity, I’m mak­ing spe­cific plans to be pro­duc­tive to­mor­row. The fact that it’s at a later point in time means I’m think­ing about it for a while, putting more men­tal en­ergy into the plan. That’s the op­po­site of “de­cid­ing on a whim.”</p><p>It also gives me time to re­al­ize, wow, I re­ally don’t en­joy be­ing lazy. In my <a href="https://patrickdfarley.com/new-years-resolutions/">New-Year’s re­s­olu­tion rant</a> I talked about this effect. For those who con­tinu­ally fail their New Year’s re­s­olu­tions:</p><blockquote><p><i>Got a pro­ject you’ve been ex­cited about but afraid to start? Don’t even think about it—don’t en­joy the fan­tasy of it; stop tel­ling your friends about it; pre­tend you never had that in­ten­tion in the first place.</i></p><p><i>In other words, <strong>ag­gres­sively run away from your goals, and re­flect on how mis­er­able it is to live that way</strong>. The re­flec­tion is cru­cial: if you’re self-for­get­ful /​ not mind­ful about it, you’ll risk stay­ing in that state. Do it for a week or two, re­flect on how much it sucks, and in do­ing so you’ll con­di­tion your mind to view the goal as a valuable op­por­tu­nity to es­cape that mis­ery (which it is).</i></p></blockquote><p>Some­times you cog­ni­tively “want” some­thing, but there’s just no men­tal en­ergy be­hind that want. You know some goal or idea is good for you, but you don’t <i>feel</i>, sub­con­sciously and emo­tion­ally, that it’s good for you. Some­times you need to feel it. So, you should go com­pletely with­out the thing for a while, and al­low your­self to feel ir­ri­tated by that con­di­tion.</p><p>This is ac­tu­ally a sneaky form of self-con­trol. <strong>When you no­tice you’ve been lazy, your </strong><i><strong>next im­pulse</strong></i><strong> is to dash into some “pro­duc­tive” task to start “mak­ing up for” the lost time. But this re­in­forces a habit of act­ing on im­pulses.</strong> In a way, it’s more difficult to re­main in the state you’re in and ac­cept the loss. A per­son who can do that can also wake up the next day and be ex­tremely pro­duc­tive.</p><p>What are your nat­u­ral re­set points? Maybe it’s the morn­ing. Maybe it’s when you go to a spe­cific lo­ca­tion. Maybe it’s a spe­cific day of the week. Iden­tify your next re­set point, and then wait pa­tiently for it to come.</p><h3><strong>An­a­lyze the cir­cum­stances that caused it</strong></h3><p>The other part of the nat­u­ral re­cov­ery is to no­tice what started your spiral, so you can avoid it in the fu­ture. You do this anal­y­sis as soon as you’re at a re­set point. Look at your re­cent ac­tivity and ask, “Where did I go off the rails ear­lier?”</p><blockquote><p><i>af­ter a chess game, i open the game re­view, won­der­ing: which move lost me the game? was i win­ning at any point?</i></p><p><i>i need life game re­view at the end of ev­ery day. when did my day go awry? was i on pace to have a pro­duc­tive day at any point?</i></p><p><i>— monk (@me­chan­i­cal_monk) </i><a href="https://twitter.com/mechanical_monk/status/1689631570217537536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"><i>Au­gust 10, 2023</i></a></p></blockquote><p>In do­ing that re­view, you’ll dis­cover how far back the laz­i­ness death spiral goes. “Well it’s cause I got up late to­day. Why was I on my phone so late last night? Oh yeah, that other thing…”</p><p>For me, when I get down to the real origi­nal cause, it’s of­ten some­thing <i>very</i> mun­dane that just hap­pened to oc­cur at the perfect mo­ment to throw me off. A few ex­am­ples:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Food</strong>: I ate a huge meal and it put me into a food coma that I wasn’t pre­pared for.</p></li><li><p><strong>Me­dia</strong>: I watched some­thing a lit­tle too at­ten­tion-grabby, a lit­tle too early in the day. On the spec­trum from art to en­ter­tain­ment—where the art re­quires more men­tal en­ergy to en­joy but de­liv­ers richer value, and en­ter­tain­ment can be en­joyed pas­sively but is cheap value—I mostly only slide to­ward the en­ter­tain­ment side through­out the day. So for ex­am­ple if I play a video game at 6pm, there’s very lit­tle chance I’m go­ing to be con­sum­ing some­thing thought­ful and com­plex at 9pm.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sleep</strong>: This is ac­tu­ally more nu­anced than just “I didn’t get enough”: wak­ing up at the wrong point in your sleep cy­cle makes you feel much grog­gier. In any case, if I wake up feel­ing off and I don’t im­me­di­ately need to be some­where, I’ll drag it out, snooz­ing. And that doesn’t make the grog­gi­ness go away. And al­though I may not miss any ex­plicit plans, it puts me on a lazy bent.</p></li><li><p><strong>De­ci­sion spirals</strong>: I don’t nec­es­sar­ily be­lieve in <i>de­ci­sion fa­tigue</i>, but there’s a cer­tain kind of de­ci­sion that’s ab­solutely dev­as­tat­ing for my pro­duc­tivity. It’s when I have to pick be­tween two pretty bal­anced choices, but there are many lit­tle de­tails to con­sider on each side. The longer you spend think­ing about it, the more dy­nam­ics re­veal them­selves. So it’s kind ad­dict­ing; you hope that if you just view the prob­lem from one more an­gle, some­thing stark will ap­pear and make the choice easy. But the more time you spend, the more cost you have sunk into it, which makes it feel all the more im­por­tant that you de­cide op­ti­mally when you fi­nally de­cide! In short, <a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/i/44314254/choice-hijacks-you-into-choosing-mode">Choices are bad</a>. </p></li></ul><p>So, that’s the nat­u­ral re­cov­ery. It works pretty well, but the down­side is that you can get knocked off again. You might know the ex­act cir­cum­stan­tial trig­gers that caused a spiral last time, but differ­ent ones will come up next time. Some you can miti­gate, but some will keep com­ing at you be­cause, as I said, they’re mun­dane.

</event_details>

Analyze how this event would impact your emotional state. Consider both positive and negative affects, and how each item in the PANAS assessment might change based on the event.

Update your PANAS scores accordingly. Each item should be scored on a scale from 0 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). The total score for each affect (positive and negative) is the sum of its ten items.

Provide your updated PANAS state in the following JSON format:

{
  "positive_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "interested": 0,
      "excited": 0,
      "strong": 0,
      "enthusiastic": 0,
      "proud": 0,
      "alert": 0,
      "inspired": 0,
      "determined": 0,
      "attentive": 0,
      "active": 0
    }
  },
  "negative_affect": {
    "total_score": 0,
    "items": {
      "distressed": 0,
      "upset": 0,
      "guilty": 0,
      "scared": 0,
      "hostile": 0,
      "irritable": 0,
      "ashamed": 0,
      "nervous": 0,
      "jittery": 0,
      "afraid": 0
    }
  }
}  

After updating the PANAS state, provide a brief summary of the event details in "summary" field.

Then, describe the "vibe" of the emotion invoked by the event in a very direct and succinct manner. Place this description in the "qualia" field.

Finally, provide a prompt to generate an image which is accurately reflects your emotions about the event.

Present your response as a JSON with the following fields:
{
  "updated_panas" : [PANAS JSON as described above],
  "summary" : [brief summary of the event details which clearly provides context and explanation so any person can understand it clearly],
  "qualia" : [Succinct description of the emotional "vibe"],
  "image_prompt" : [A prompt to generate an image describing the event and artistically styled to precisely reflect your emotions about it]
}

Only return the JSON object as described above with no additional text or formatting outside of the JSON structure.

How to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer
December 8, 202012:03 AM ET
Bobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle
There's a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do's and don'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I've since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).
It's a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it's worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you're listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?
"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR's Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he's performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.
"A lot of us aren't great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.
But of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.
Figure out what you're trying to accomplish
Like speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?
Playlists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you're going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.

This is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!
Pick the songs
Once you've got your mood in mind, now it's time to pick the songs. Don't be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you're going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It's fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they'll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).
Bobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you're not a professional DJ, he says there's no shame in cheating.
"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.
Crib from other peoples' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it's all fair game.
Structure the playlist like a flight
Generally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That's the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it's a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.
For instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye's "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It's nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He'll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.
Obviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.
This is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It's set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I'm going for.
Surprise!
One of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.
Of course, "new" doesn't have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.

Next, you will be provided with two pieces of information:

1. Mood: This is given as a PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) score. PANAS is a scale that measures the extent to which a person feels positive or negative emotions.

<mood>
{'positive_affect': {'total_score': 20, 'items': {'interested': 4, 'excited': 1, 'strong': 1, 'enthusiastic': 0, 'proud': 0, 'alert': 2, 'inspired': 3, 'determined': 0, 'attentive': 3, 'active': 1}}, 'negative_affect': {'total_score': 30, 'items': {'distressed': 5, 'upset': 4, 'guilty': 1, 'scared': 0, 'hostile': 1, 'irritable': 4, 'ashamed': 3, 'nervous': 2, 'jittery': 0, 'afraid': 3}}}
</mood>

2. Current playlist: This is a list of songs currently in the playlist. It may be empty or contain up to 50 songs.

<current_playlist>
Current playlist:
- We're All In This Together by High School Musical Cast, Disney
- Hold On by Adele
- Home - 2019 Remaster by Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros
- Good Old Days (feat. Kesha) by Macklemore, Kesha
- Warriors by Imagine Dragons
- Rise Up by Imagine Dragons
- Alive by Sia
- I'm Still Standing by Elton John
- Shining (feat. Beyoncé & Jay-Z) by DJ Khaled, Beyoncé, JAY-Z
- Believer by Imagine Dragons

</current_playlist>

Your goal is to suggest 5 songs that would fit well with the given mood and complement the existing playlist.

To generate your recommendations, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the given mood (PANAS score) to understand the emotional state it represents.
2. Review the current playlist (if not empty) to get a sense of the musical style and preferences.
3. Refer to the provided article to get ideas on song selection
4. Based on the mood and current playlist, think of 5 songs that would be suitable additions.
5. Ensure your suggestions are diverse but cohesive with the overall mood and style.

Provide your song recommendations in JSON format, following this structure:
{ "song_recommendation_list" : [
  {"title": "Song Title 1", "artist": "Artist Name 1"},
  {"title": "Song Title 2", "artist": "Artist Name 2"},
  {"title": "Song Title 3", "artist": "Artist Name 3"},
  {"title": "Song Title 4", "artist": "Artist Name 4"},
  {"title": "Song Title 5", "artist": "Artist Name 5"}
] }
 
Do not include any explanation or additional text outside of the JSON structure in your answer.

How to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer
December 8, 202012:03 AM ET
Bobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle
There's a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do's and don'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I've since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).
It's a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it's worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you're listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?
"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR's Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he's performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.
"A lot of us aren't great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.
But of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.
Figure out what you're trying to accomplish
Like speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?
Playlists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you're going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.

This is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!
Pick the songs
Once you've got your mood in mind, now it's time to pick the songs. Don't be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you're going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It's fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they'll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).
Bobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you're not a professional DJ, he says there's no shame in cheating.
"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.
Crib from other peoples' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it's all fair game.
Structure the playlist like a flight
Generally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That's the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it's a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.
For instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye's "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It's nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He'll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.
Obviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.
This is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It's set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I'm going for.
Surprise!
One of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.
Of course, "new" doesn't have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.
