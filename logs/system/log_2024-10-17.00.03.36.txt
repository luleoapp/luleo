The legislation has been justified by proponents under the guise of preserving traditional family structures; however, opponents argue that it disregards the many forms of family that exist in society today. The backlash includes protests and calls for international scrutiny, as critics emphasize the need for a more inclusive approach that recognizes and supports diverse family dynamics. Supporters of the law claim it aims to protect children and promote a specific social framework, but the reality, according to LGBT activists, is one of exclusion and harm.

BEIRUT/WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - At least one Israeli strike hit Beirut's southern suburbs early on Wednesday morning, Reuters witnesses said, hours after the U.S. said it opposed the scope of Israeli attacks in Beirut amid a rising death toll and fears of wider regional escalation.Reuters witnesses heard two blasts and saw plumes of smoke emerging from two separate neighbourhoods. It came after Israel issued an evacuation order early on Wednesday which mentioned only one building.The Israeli military has in recent weeks carried out strikes on Beirut's southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold, without advance warnings, or issued a warning for one area while striking more broadly.The Israeli military said it conducted a strike on an underground Hezbollah weapons stockpile in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh."Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including advancing warnings to the population in the area," the Israeli military said.Israeli military evacuation orders were also affecting more than a quarter of Lebanon, according to the U.N. refugee agency, two weeks after Israel began incursions into the south of the country that it says are aimed at driving back Hezbollah.Some Western countries have been pushing for a ceasefire between the two neighbours, as well as in Gaza, though the United States says it continues to support Israel and was sending an anti-missile system and troops.On Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the U.S. had expressed its concerns to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration on the recent strikes."When it comes to the scope and nature of the bombing campaign that we saw in Beirut over the past few weeks, it's something that we made clear to the government of Israel we had concerns with and we were opposed to," he told reporters, adopting a harsher tone than Washington has taken so far.The last time Beirut was hit was on Oct. 10, when two strikes near the city centre killed 22 people and brought down entire buildings in a densely populated neighbourhood.LEADERS AND INFRASTRUCTURE TARGETEDThe Middle East, meanwhile, has been on edge since Iran attacked Israel with a barrage of missiles on Oct. 1 after a similar large-scale operation in April. Israel has promised to retaliate.Iran's allies in its "Axis of Resistance" to Israeli and U.S. interests - Lebanon's Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthis and armed groups in Iraq - have staged attacks in the region in support of Hamas in the Gaza war, complicating efforts to ease tensions.Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi is visiting Jordan, Egypt and Turkey as part of Tehran's diplomatic reach-out to countries of the region "to end genocide, atrocity and aggression", the Iranian foreign ministry's spokesperson said on Wednesday in a post on X.Israel has been turning up the heat on Iran's most powerful regional ally Hezbollah since it began incursions into Lebanon after killing Hezbollah leaders and commanders, including its veteran secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah last month in the biggest blow to the group in decades.On Tuesday, Netanyahu told President Emmanuel Macron of France during a phone conversation that he opposed a unilateral ceasefire and said he was "taken aback" by Macron's plan to hold a conference on Lebanon, according to an Israeli readout."A reminder to the French President: It was not a UN decision that established the State of Israel but the victory that was achieved in the War of Independence ... ," Netanyahu's office said in a separate statement.The Elysee Palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The pair have previously clashed, including over Macron's call to halt arm sales to Israel.With diplomatic efforts stalled, the fighting continues.Israeli strikes in Lebanon have killed at least 2,350 people over the last year and left nearly 11,000 wounded, according to the health ministry, and more than 1.2 million people have been displaced.The toll does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but includes hundreds of women and children.The figures underscore the heavy price Lebanese are paying as Israel tries to destroy Hezbollah's infrastructure in their conflict, which resumed a year ago when it began firing rockets at Israel in support of Hamas at the start of the Gaza war.

Recent weeks have seen heightened tensions in the region due to Iran's missile attacks on Israel and the retaliatory responses from Hezbollah and other Iranian allies. The U.S. continues to back Israel, providing military support, yet has urged caution regarding the scope of attacks. Israeli strikes in Lebanon have resulted in significant casualties, with at least 2,350 dead and thousands wounded over the past year, amidst ongoing conflict provoked by solidarity actions with Hamas. Diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire appear stalled, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu rejecting unilateral ceasefire proposals and continuing military operations aimed at dismantling Hezbollah's capabilities, escalating a humanitarian crisis in Lebanon, affecting civilians as well as militants."}

This incident adds to broader concerns about individual freedoms where creative expressions are stifled in fear of institutional backlash. The response to the drawing reflects a wider narrative of suppression and the struggle for peaceful discourse in the face of militarization and conflict. Moskalev’s daughter's drawing, therefore, resonates as a call for peace and illustrates the delicate balance between creative expression and governmental control, spotlighting the need for societal dialogues centered around love and unity over war and division."}

GENEVA/DUBAI Oct 15 (Reuters) - Israel, which began incursions into south Lebanon two weeks ago to battle Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, has issued military evacuation orders affecting more than a quarter of the country, the U.N. refugee agency said on Tuesday.The figures underscore the heavy price Lebanese are paying as Israel steps up its campaign to defeat Hezbollah and destroy its infrastructure in their one-year conflict.The U.N. refugee agency's Middle East Director Rema Jamous Imseis told a press briefing in Geneva that new Israeli evacuation orders to 20 villages in southern Lebanon meant that over a quarter of the country was now affected."People are heeding these calls to evacuate, and they're fleeing with almost nothing."Israeli strikes have killed at least 2,309 people over the last year, the Lebanese government said, and more than 1.2 million people have been displaced.The majority have been killed since late September when Israel expanded its military campaign. The toll does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.Around 50 Israelis, both soldiers and civilians, have been killed, according to Israel.Israel says its operation in Lebanon aims to secure the return of tens of thousands of its residents forced to flee their homes in northern Israel due to Hezbollah attacks.Israel expanded its bombing campaign in Lebanon on Monday, killing at least 22 people - most of them women - in an airstrike in the north on a house where displaced people were seeking refuge from Israeli strikes further south, health officials said."What we are hearing is that amongst the 22 people killed were 12 women and two children," U.N. human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told the same press briefing in response to a question about Monday's strike on Christian-majority Aitou."We understand it was a four-story residential building that was struck. With these factors in mind, we have real concerns with respect to IHL (International Humanitarian Law), so the laws of war, and the principles of distinction proportion and proportionality," he said, calling for an investigation into the incident.Rescue workers were still pulling bodies out of the rubble in Aitou on Tuesday, local media reported, following one of the deadliest strikes on displaced families in Lebanon, after strikes earlier this month on the southern Lebanese town of Ain Deleb that left more than 30 dead.Israel has not commented on the Aitou strike, but has repeatedly said it takes all possible precautions to avoid civilian casualties.UN CONCERNED OVER PEACEKEEPER ATTACKSSo far the main focus of Israel's military operations in Lebanon has been in the Bekaa Valley in the east, the suburbs of Beirut, and in the south, where U.N. peacekeepers have said that Israeli fire has hit their bases on numerous occasions and wounded peacekeepers.The U.N. Security Council on Monday expressed strong concern after several peacekeeping positions in southern Lebanon again came under fire amid clashes between the Israeli military and Hezbollah.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visiting a military base in central Israel where four soldiers were killed on Sunday by a Hezbollah drone strike, said Israel would continue to attack the movement "without mercy, everywhere in Lebanon – including Beirut".The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah resumed a year ago when the militant group began firing rockets at Israel in support of Hamas at the start of the Gaza war.Meanwhile, the Middle East remains on high alert for Israel to retaliate against Iran for an Oct. 1 barrage of missiles launched in response to Israel's assaults on Lebanon.Netanyahu's office said Israel would listen to the United States but would decide its actions according to its own national interest.The statement was attached to a Washington Post article which said Netanyahu had told President Joe Biden's administration that Israel would strike Iranian military, not nuclear or oil, targets - suggesting a more limited counterstrike aimed at preventing a full-scale war.Qatar's emir accused Israel on Tuesday of exploiting "international inaction" on the Middle East crisis to move beyond its "aggression" in Gaza to build more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank and send troops into Lebanon."Israel deliberately chose to expand the aggression to implement pre-planned schemes in other locations such as the West Bank and Lebanon because it sees that the scope for that is available," Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani said in his annual speech to open Qatar's Shura Council.Qatar, the United States and Egypt have repeatedly mediated in an attempt to end the war in Gaza, which broke out a year ago when fighters from the Palestinian militant group Hamas burst into Israel from Gaza and killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.Israel's offensive has killed more than 42,000 people in Gaza, turned the enclave into piles of cement and twisted metal and created severe shortages of food, water and fuel.

2024-10-17 04:03:08,809 - system - INFO - Response JSON: {'summary': "Israel's military operations in southern Lebanon, launched two weeks ago against the Hezbollah militant group, have led to significant civilian displacement and casualties. The U.N. refugee agency reported that ongoing evacuation orders affect over a quarter of Lebanon, with people fleeing with minimal belongings. In the past year, Israeli strikes have reportedly resulted in at least 2,309 deaths and displaced over 1.2 million people in Lebanon, with the toll increasing sharply since late September. Recent airstrikes, including one that killed 22 civilians in Aitou, have raised concerns regarding compliance with international humanitarian law. Despite these casualties, Israel maintains that its operations aim to protect its citizens from Hezbollah attacks. Tensions remain high, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu vowing to continue military actions across Lebanon. The situation is further complicated by ongoing violence in Gaza, where over 42,000 people have died due to Israeli offensives. Qatari officials criticized Israel for expanding its military actions amid perceived international inaction, suggesting a coordinated strategy to extend conflict beyond Gaza to the West Bank and Lebanon. The U.N. Security Council has expressed concern over attacks on peacekeeper positions in Lebanon as the conflict continues to escalate."}
