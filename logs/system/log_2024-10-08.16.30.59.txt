<p>One of my fa­vorite sto­ries grow­ing up was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traitor-Star-Wars-Jedi-Order/dp/034542865X">Star Wars: Traitor</a>, by Matthew Stover.</p><p>The book is short, if you want to read it. Spoilers fol­low. (I took a look at it again re­cently and I think it didn’t ob­vi­ously hold up as real adult fic­tion, al­though quite good if you haven’t yet had your mind blown that many times)</p><p>One anec­dote from the story has stayed with me and shows up in my wor­ld­view from time to time.</p><p>The story be­gins with “Ja­cen Solo has been cap­tured, and is be­ing tor­tured.”</p><p>He is be­ing <i>ex­tremely</i> tor­tured. He’s in a white room, with a de­vice con­nected through­out his ner­vous sys­tem, in­flict­ing max­i­mum white-hot agony. When­ever the suffer­ing be­comes so great that his body tunes it out, it gives him just enough time to re­lax to hurt all the more when it abruptly starts up again. </p><p>Every day, an alien woman comes to visit him. She talks to him, dur­ing lulls in the tor­ture, about philos­o­phy and life and his­tory. She asks him what he thinks about things. He says “I think I’m be­ing fuck­ing tor­tured. Can you please help?”, and she kind of ig­nores him and goes on talk­ing about philos­o­phy and life and his­tory and stuff. Some­times he tries more clever ways to pry in­for­ma­tion out of her, to no avail.</p><p>After sev­eral weeks (or months?) of this, at some point he asks again “Se­ri­ously what the hell? Who are you? What is hap­pen­ing to me? Why are you tor­tur­ing me, or, not helping? What is go­ing on?”</p><p>She says: “Do you know what a shad­ow­moth is?”</p><p>“An­swer my fuck­ing ques­tion”</p><p>“Do you know what a shad­ow­moth is?”</p><p>“Fine, a shad­ow­moth is a life form na­tive to Cor­us­cant. They’re sili­con-based, their wingflutes make mu­sic once they leave the co­coon and can fly.”</p><p>She nods, and says “Once, I saw a shad­ow­moth in its co­coon, strug­gling. Like you, I am sen­si­tive to the force – I didn’t merely em­pathize with it, but I felt it. When shad­ow­moths strive to break free from their co­coon, they are in pain. I felt it’s pain. And I felt it’s envy of the other moths, already free, fly­ing, mak­ing mu­sic. I wanted to help it.”</p><p>Ja­cen shud­ders. “Oh no, you didn’t –”</p><p>“Yes. I cut it free.”</p><p>“No –”</p><p>“It sounds like you know what hap­pened next?”</p><p>Ja­cen says: “If they don’t es­cape from the co­coon on their own, they’ll never be strong enough to fly, and they suffer and starve to death, worse than what they were ex­pe­rienc­ing in the co­coon.”</p><p>“In­deed.”<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefm4kuzcus6g9"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnm4kuzcus6g9">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>The two of them sit for awhile. The tor­ture ma­chine gives Ja­cen an­other wave of White Pain. Then the woman says “Sup­pose you did want to help a shad­ow­moth. What would you do, if you couldn’t cut it free? You might sit with it, and let it know that it’s not alone, and that it’s pain is in the ser­vice of it’s des­tiny.”</p><p>And then she leaves for the day.</p><p>And, then, it oc­curs to Ja­cen:</p><p>It’s been months. They haven’t asked him any ques­tions. There is no in­di­ca­tion that they par­tic­u­larly want any­thing from him. There is no in­di­ca­tion that the White Hot Tor­ture will ever stop.</p><p>What would he do, if this was liter­ally the only thing there would ever be? Just him, and the White, and this in­scrutable alien woman...</p><p>...ba­si­cally, the only ac­tion he <i>can</i> do, is to change his re­la­tional stance to the tor­ture, and learn to stop car­ing about it.</p><p>The last sen­tence of that chap­ter is “Ja­cen Solo be­gins to eat away at the White.”</p><p>...</p><p>A few weeks later, he has ba­si­cally in­vented Bud­dhist En­light­en­ment from first prin­ci­ples. He feels the pain, but does not suffer. He con­verses freely with the woman about philos­o­phy and his­tory and life and stuff.</p><p>And, then, his cap­tors say “Con­grat­u­la­tions. You have passed the first test. You are now ready for the sec­ond phase of your train­ing.”<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefsy6o6b4acfm"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnsy6o6b4acfm">[2]</a></sup></span></p><hr /><p>Now, there are a few things I have to say about this.</p><p>First, to fore­stall the ob­vi­ous ob­jec­tions: The tran­shu­man­ist an­swer to “what if painful suffer­ing is nec­es­sary to learn valuable life les­sons?” is <i>“skill is­sue.”</i> </p><p>If you can’t figure out how to let shad­ow­moths out of co­coons with­out them suffer­ing and dy­ing, maybe you can just in­vent bet­ter biotech un­til this is no longer nec­es­sary. In mean­time, sure, have some equa­nim­ity about it. But don’t let that equa­nim­ity stop you from try­ing to im­prove the world.</p><p>But, bet­ter biotech might take thou­sands of years (or, like, at least a decade) to in­vent, and you might have to deal with a situ­a­tion in the mean­while any­way. And I do think there is some­thing pow­er­ful here about <i>never los­ing your lo­cus of con­trol.</i> And there’s some­thing im­por­tant about “Some­times, at least for now, the best way to learn some things in­volves strug­gling and figur­ing things out for your­self. Teach­ers can help point you to the door but you’ll have to walk through it your­self.”</p><p>Also, per­haps the even more ob­vi­ous first ob­jec­tion: in this story, the woman is out to ma­nipu­late Ja­cen into be­com­ing a differ­ent sort of per­son. In the con­text of the story, I think that many of the changes to Ja­cen’s char­ac­ter are ac­tu­ally good by Ja­cen’s origi­nal lights<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefce0hjams2rw"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnce0hjams2rw">[3]</a></sup></span>, but to be clear I do not en­dorse kid­nap­ping peo­ple and tor­tur­ing them even if you can ar­gue it’s for their own good some­how. Or, most things that that would di­rectly be a metaphor for<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefkftf3hbkncf"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnkftf3hbkncf">[4]</a></sup></span>. </p><p>But in the con­text of “things you ac­tu­ally con­sented to”, or “things re­al­ity is forc­ing upon you with­out any­one else re­ally be­ing in­volved at all”, there are two par­tic­u­lar an­gles that come up for me a fair amount.</p><h3><strong>The first an­gle is </strong><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/cbWoMepny3Jo9XqEr/metastrategic-brainstorming-a-core-building-block-skill"><strong>metastrategy</strong></a></h3><p>The goal of my <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/s/skTdjtx87XKurdvWf">ra­tio­nal­ity train­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion</a> is not to pro­duce peo­ple who are good at re­search­ing a par­tic­u­lar do­main, or solv­ing a par­tic­u­lar class of prob­lem. If you are work­ing in a known field, the thing to do is find ex­perts in that field and learn from them. Some­times they may need to im­prove their ped­a­gogy, or learn to ar­tic­u­late their tacit knowl­edge bet­ter. You can learn to <a href="https://commoncog.com/how-to-learn-tacit-knowledge/">ex­tract tacit knowl­edge from peo­ple</a>, and you can learn to ex­tract more knowl­edge from text­books, etc.</p><p>But, for prob­lems <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/CSZnj2YNMKGfsMbZA/specializing-in-problems-we-don-t-understand">we don’t un­der­stand yet</a>, there may just not be an es­tab­lished field to learn from.</p><p>There, you need the skill of ei­ther in­vent­ing new skills, or con­nect­ing dots be­tween dis­parate ex­ist­ing fields that no­body has yet in­te­grated. I think you need some kind of <i>gen­er­al­ized </i>re­search taste, that tells you what to do when no­body in the world is ca­pa­ble of au­thor­i­ta­tively giv­ing you the an­swer, and the spe­cial­ized re­search tastes of var­i­ous fields might be sub­tly lead­ing you astray, like a physi­cist as­sum­ing they can model ev­ery­thing as spher­i­cal cows, or an ML re­searcher <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/67fNBeHrjdrZZNDDK/defining-alignment-research#Valuable_property_2__scientific_approach">as­sum­ing they can con­tinue to be be­hav­iorist about their re­search</a> as they push the fron­tier to­wards su­per­in­tel­li­gence.</p><p>For this rea­son, my <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/JXcuXhtWoyYNWCt5b/interested-in-cognitive-bootcamp">train­ing</a> is very “shad­ow­moth-y”. Much of my pro­cess is “make peo­ple solve a prob­lem they don’t know how to solve, and challenge them to figure it out.” </p><p>I think there is some art to be­ing “ex­actly the right amount of cryp­tic and an­noy­ing”, and to find­ing prob­lems that form a rea­son­able difficulty curve for peo­ple with var­i­ous differ­ent start­ing skills. I don’t know that I’ve hit this bal­ance well yet. The tran­shu­man­ist an­swer to shad­ow­moth­ism still ap­plies – if I can give peo­ple clues that help them learn the right metaskills with­out be­ing so painful and an­noy­ing, all the bet­ter. </p><p>But I try, where pos­si­ble, to only give peo­ple the ear­liest hints on a thought chain, nudg­ing them to­wards the right meta­tools to in­vent/​re­mem­ber the right meta­tools to find/​re­mem­ber the right ob­ject level tools to solve a given prob­lem.</p><h3><strong>The sec­ond an­gle is some­thing like “re­silient self-own­er­ship and lo­cus of con­trol.”</strong></h3><p>Long ago, a friend of mine had re­cently emo­tion­ally grokked ex­is­ten­tial risk – he had known about and “be­lieved in” it for years, but some­how this par­tic­u­lar week things clicked and he was feel­ing more of the full force of it. He felt very afraid, and didn’t know what to do.</p><p>He asked a men­tor for ad­vice. She asked “What does the fear feel like?”</p><p>He didn’t ar­tic­u­late any­thing very clearly.</p><p>She fol­lowed up with “Does it feel more like a tiger is chas­ing you, or more like you want to curl up and hope that your par­ents come and fix it?”</p><p>“The sec­ond one.”</p><p>She nod­ded. “I think that kind of fear does make sense in the an­ces­tral en­vi­ron­ment (and of­ten to­day). Some­times you’re afraid and it <i>is</i> the right thing to do to get help, and maybe curl up to con­serve re­sources mean­while.</p><p>“The thing is, though, that your par­ents re­ally can’t help you here. Mom can’t stop x-risk. So, that kind of fear… it just isn’t very use­ful.”</p><p>I can imag­ine peo­ple for whom this would be ex­actly the wrong thing to say. But, my friend nod­ded, and… some­thing sub­sided in him. Fully un­der­stand­ing what the fear was for, and why it wasn’t helpful, al­lowed him to pro­cess and let go of it. </p><p>“Fully un­der­stand­ing an emo­tion such that you can let it go” is ac­tu­ally a sep­a­rate topic, which de­serves it’s own post. For now, I’m bring­ing this up be­cause the move of: “Oh, my [par­ents/​friends/​so­ciety] ac­tu­ally re­ally won’t save me here, I <i>have</i> to some­how change some­thing in­side my­self in­stead of wait­ing, or try­ing to change some­thing out­side my­self” is an im­por­tant move to be ca­pa­ble of mak­ing some­times.</p><p>This played a role in the first Ma­jor Griev­ing that kicked off my in­ter­est in <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/gs3vp3ukPbpaEie5L/deliberate-grieving-1">De­liber­ate Griev­ing</a> – I thought some­one had wronged me. I wanted my peer group to some­how de­cide ei­ther that yes, they had wronged me, and ex­press that judg­ment. Or, judge that “ac­tu­ally, so-and-so re­ally didn’t ac­tu­ally wrong Rae­mon, this is Rae­mon’s job to ad­just to.” Or some­thing.</p><p>But, this was dur­ing the pan­demic, and my peer group was busy deal­ing with their own prob­lems, and it re­ally didn’t make sense to call a tribunal about it. </p><p>What if so­cial re­al­ity <i>just wasn’t go­ing to is­sue a ver­dict here?</i></p><p>What would I do?</p><p>In that case, the thing to do was grieve. Rec­og­nize that yes, there was some le­gi­t­i­mate rea­son that hav­ing Jus­tice here would be right and good, but that it wasn’t go­ing to hap­pen. And let go some­how.</p><p>More re­cently, I was deal­ing with an ex­haust­ing se­ries of prob­lems, and talk­ing to a friend who was ex­pe­rienc­ing a very similar set of prob­lems. I found my­self say­ing “I want you… I want you to say that I’m Good. To say that I’ve done enough.”<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref0tzm0vsid6kc"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fn0tzm0vsid6kc">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>And my friend sadly said “Yeah. I also want some­one to say that to me, Ray. </p><p>“The thing is, get­ting that from out­side isn’t ever re­ally enough. I think you need to some­how be­come the sort of per­son who de­cides for them­selves whether they’re good enough, and to not need it from some kind of ex­ter­nal val­i­da­tion.”</p><p><i>Fuck.</i></p><p>What if there would never be some­one I trusted who could tell me I was Good Enough, that things were in some sense <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/nsLeY7SZjHZYTPK7t/everything-okay">Okay</a>? </p><p>What if I had to learn to do that my­self? </p><p>Or, worse, what if I had to re­ally ac­knowl­edge that it was the wrong ques­tion to ask?</p><hr /><p>I think, for many peo­ple, it’s im­por­tant at some point to gain a true sort of in­de­pen­dence, the way these fables and anec­dotes ges­ture at. The Shad­ow­moth Strug­gle is still, of­ten, a nec­es­sary part of re­al­ity.</p><p>The tran­shu­man­ist re­join­der is still im­por­tant. Some­times your friends can help you. Some­times you can in­vent bet­ter ped­a­gog­i­cal tech­niques, or just ac­tu­ally tell some­one they’re Good Enough in a way that lands and that their soul re­ally be­lieves and up­dates on in an en­dur­ing way. We’re so­cial crea­tures. I’m pretty sure my hu­man val­ues ul­ti­mately say: it is good for peo­ple to help each other in this way.</p><p>But, I think it is also a worth­while goal, to be the sort of per­son ca­pa­ble of en­dur­ing and grow­ing and striv­ing, even if at the mo­ment you are an is­land.</p><p>Dig through the co­coon, such that your wings might make mu­sic in the skies of dis­tant planets.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefxiuhh0fb1y"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnxiuhh0fb1y">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p><i>        It mat­ters not how strait the gate,</i><br /><i>        How charged with pun­ish­ments the scroll,</i><br />.       <i>I am the mas­ter of my fate,</i><br /><i>        I am the lo­cus of con­trol.</i></p><p><i>                              – William Ernest Hen­ley and Ken­zie Amodei</i></p><ol class="footnote-section footnotes"><li class="footnote-item" id="fnm4kuzcus6g9"><span class="footnote-back-link"><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnrefm4kuzcus6g9">^</a></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>The metaphor of “moths strug­gling to es­cape a co­coon and need­ing to do so on their own” also shows up in the TV show Lost, but, in the rele­vant epi­sode, the metaphor ends here, right be­fore we get to the im­por­tant bit.</p></div></li><li class="footnote-item" id="fnsy6o6b4acfm"><span class="footnote-back-link"><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnrefsy6o6b4acfm">^</a></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>The sec­ond phase of his train­ing is also fairly in­ter­est­ing.

How to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer
December 8, 202012:03 AM ET
Bobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle
There's a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do's and don'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I've since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).
It's a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it's worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you're listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?
"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR's Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he's performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.
"A lot of us aren't great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.
But of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.
Figure out what you're trying to accomplish
Like speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?
Playlists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you're going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.
Sponsor Message
This is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!
Pick the songs
Once you've got your mood in mind, now it's time to pick the songs. Don't be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you're going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It's fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they'll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).
Bobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you're not a professional DJ, he says there's no shame in cheating.
"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.
Crib from other peoples' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it's all fair game.
Structure the playlist like a flight
Generally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That's the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it's a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.
For instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye's "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It's nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He'll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.
Obviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.
This is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It's set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I'm going for.
Surprise!
One of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.
Of course, "new" doesn't have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.

Next, you will be provided with two pieces of information:

1. Mood: This is given as a PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) score. PANAS is a scale that measures the extent to which a person feels positive or negative emotions.

<mood>
{'positive_affect': {'total_score': 9, 'items': {'interested': 5, 'excited': 1, 'strong': 0, 'enthusiastic': 1, 'proud': 0, 'alert': 0, 'inspired': 2, 'determined': 0, 'attentive': 0, 'active': 0}}, 'negative_affect': {'total_score': 30, 'items': {'distressed': 5, 'upset': 5, 'guilty': 0, 'scared': 0, 'hostile': 5, 'irritable': 4, 'ashamed': 0, 'nervous': 4, 'jittery': 0, 'afraid': 7}}}
</mood>

2. Current playlist: This is a list of songs currently in the playlist. It may be empty or contain up to 50 songs.

<current_playlist>
Current playlist:
- The Ghost of Tom Joad by Bruce Springsteen
- To Love Somebody by Jade Bird
- Cigarette Daydreams by Cage The Elephant
- Nervous by Shawn Mendes
- Adagio for Strings (From "The Elephant Man" & "Platoon") by Samuel Barber, Cincinnati Pops Orchestra, Erich Kunzel
- Skyfall by Adele
- Creep by Radiohead
- Ain't No Rest for the Wicked by Cage The Elephant
- Let It All Go by RHODES, Birdy
- Thunder by Imagine Dragons

</current_playlist>

Your goal is to suggest 5 songs that would fit well with the given mood and complement the existing playlist.

To generate your recommendations, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the given mood (PANAS score) to understand the emotional state it represents.
2. Review the current playlist (if not empty) to get a sense of the musical style and preferences.
3. Refer to the provided article to get ideas on song selection
4. Based on the mood and current playlist, think of 5 songs that would be suitable additions.
5. Ensure your suggestions are diverse but cohesive with the overall mood and style.

Provide your song recommendations in JSON format, following this structure:
{ "song_recommendation_list" : [
  {"title": "Song Title 1", "artist": "Artist Name 1"},
  {"title": "Song Title 2", "artist": "Artist Name 2"},
  {"title": "Song Title 3", "artist": "Artist Name 3"},
  {"title": "Song Title 4", "artist": "Artist Name 4"},
  {"title": "Song Title 5", "artist": "Artist Name 5"}
] }
 
Do not include any explanation or additional text outside of the JSON structure in your answer.
