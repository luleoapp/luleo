2024-11-05 05:01:35,962 - system - INFO - Processed response: {'summary': 'Recent research has revealed that male mosquitoes exhibiting mutations struggle to find mates, a discovery that could present a novel method for controlling mosquito populations. The study indicates that these mutant males possess traits that hinder their mating success, potentially leading to reduced reproduction rates in mosquito populations. By harnessing this knowledge, scientists are considering introducing these mutant males into existing mosquito populations as a strategy for population management. This approach is innovative, as it targets the mating behavior of mosquitoes rather than relying solely on traditional methods like pesticides, which can have harmful environmental impacts. The implications of this research extend beyond mosquito control; it also highlights the potential for using genetic mutation strategies in managing other pest species. However, further research is needed to understand the long-term effects of this method on ecosystems and native wildlife. Ultimately, this work underscores the significance of understanding mosquito behavior and genetics, paving the way for sustainable solutions to combat diseases spread by these insects, such as malaria and dengue fever.'}

However, should one candidate begin to pull ahead, several factors could contribute to this shift. First, voter turnout and enthusiasm play a crucial role; strong grassroots campaigns and effective mobilization can drive more supporters to the polls. Additionally, messaging and national issues, such as the economy and healthcare, can resonate differently with voters, swaying their preferences. Candidates also need to navigate changing demographics, with younger voters having distinct priorities compared to older generations. The influence of endorsements and party loyalty could further impact voter decisions, as prominent figures align with specific candidates, potentially consolidating support. Lastly, the role of media coverage cannot be overlooked, as increased visibility may galvanize a candidate's image and voter appeal. If one candidate successfully capitalizes on these dynamics by fostering a strong connection with their base and addressing pressing concerns, they could gain the momentum needed to clinch the lead in this tight race. Understanding these underlying elements is essential as the competition evolves and strategies shift leading up to the election."}

About a quar­ter of par­ti­ci­pants ranked it in their top 3 of courses at the camp and half of them had it listed as their fa­vorite.</p><p>I hadn’t ex­pected that.</p><p>I thought my life ad­vice was pretty idiosyn­cratic. I never heard of any­one liv­ing their life like I have. I never en­coun­tered this method in all the self-help blogs or feel-bet­ter books I con­sumed back when I needed them.</p><p>But if some peo­ple found it helpful, then I should prob­a­bly write it all down.</p><h1><strong>Why Listen to Me Though?</strong></h1><p>I think it’s gen­er­ally worth pri­ori­tiz­ing the ad­vice of peo­ple who have ac­tu­ally achieved the things you care about in life. I can’t tell you if that’s me, but I can tell you a bit about my life, why I ended up de­vel­op­ing the heuris­tics I did, and how that worked out for me.</p><p><s>I spawned in on the server</s> I mean, I was <i>born</i> on a farm in a ru­ral part of the Nether­lands. My par­ents had more kids than money. We were Dutch poor, which is ba­si­cally kind of fine. It means we all shared bed­rooms, had bor­ing food, and our car would break down… Then you’d get out and push the car. And I thought this was great cause I was the youngest of four kids, and ev­ery­thing was a game. My fam­ily doted on me, I had loads of friends, and ev­ery­one I knew was healthy. Over­all, I’d give my child­hood a <span class="frac"><sup>10</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub></span> for hap­piness, love and qual­ity of life.</p><p>On the other hand, grow­ing up, no one in my fam­ily had a de­gree. My en­tire town was blue col­lar jobs. And if you didn’t want to go to school, you worked at one of the nearby fac­to­ries. So when I grad­u­ated from high school and I wanted to ap­ply to MIT, ev­ery­one told me that wasn’t real. That was a thing peo­ple did on TV. Nor­mal peo­ple couldn’t do that. It’s like be­com­ing a Hol­ly­wood ac­tor or an as­tro­naut.</p><p>So I didn’t ap­ply.</p><p>In­stead I went to the most pres­ti­gious col­lege in the Nether­lands, which was … fine?</p><p>That’s when I hit a wall. This wall con­sisted of many parts not rele­vant to this story. But one part was the ab­solute hor­ror of pick­ing any ca­reer to work for 40 hours a week for 40 years.</p><p>That’s what ev­ery­one did where I was from.</p><p>I could read books or the in­ter­net about peo­ple who did other things but I couldn’t imag­ine how to be like them. And be­sides, all that stuff was not “real”. Man­ual la­bor was real. 9-5s were real. Pick­ing a trade was real.</p><p>I wanted to throw my­self off a bridge.</p><p>In­stead, among other things, I de­vel­oped my own set of life wis­doms fo­cused on find­ing a path when I couldn’t see any way to get where I wanted to go. There have been a lot of ups and downs since then, but in the first 10 years some wild stuff hap­pened ac­cord­ing to my small-town brain cause…</p><ul><li><p>at 21, I was se­lected from 600 col­leagues, be­com­ing the sec­ond youngest Head Tester at Elec­tronic Arts, man­ag­ing teams of 4-16 testers.</p></li><li><p>at 24, I ran an ex­per­i­ment for the Euro­pean Space Agency on Antarc­tica. Un­re­lat­edly, I was also offered a lu­cra­tive mon­e­ti­za­tion con­tract for my 3 month old Youtube chan­nel.</p></li><li><p>At 25, I was offered a PhD and got my de­gree in Player Model­ing in Video Games—a field I didn’t know ex­isted till I got the offer.</p></li><li><p>At 28, I found out an es­say I had writ­ten for fun had be­come part of the cur­ricu­lum at the MIT Me­dia Lab.</p></li><li><p>At 30, I be­came se­nior data sci­en­tist at one of the largest video game pub­lish­ers in the world (Square Enix West).

Then you will have achieved the goal of “be­com­ing a doc­tor”. To heal peo­ple … you can do so many things. You could be a nurse or a med­i­cal tech­ni­cian. You could de­velop a new glu­cose pump for chil­dren with di­a­betes. You could re­search a cure for Corona, Ebola, or Pneu­mo­nia. You could raise aware­ness for Leukemia, Dyslexia, or Es­to­nia. There are so many ways to help peo­ple get healthier, and if none of the ex­ist­ing ones suit you, you can liter­ally try and in­vent a new way to con­tribute.</p><p>In essence, a di­rec­tion let’s you figure out where your ex­act per­son-shape fits into the world to gen­er­ate a ton of “heal peo­ple”—the ac­tual thing you care about.</p><p>But how do you figure out your di­rec­tion?</p><p>Well, all I can say is how <i>I</i> did it.</p><p>My di­rec­tion ended up be­ing “con­tribute to the de­vel­op­ment of AAA video games”.</p><p>Not that that was my first pick.</p><p>My first pick was “be­com­ing a doc­tor” (which, for the record, is a goal. But this es­say makes the de­vel­op­ment of these heuris­tics seem more clean and chronolog­i­cal than what the ac­tual messy re­al­ity was like).</p><p>So I signed up for this pre-med track where you get to fol­low around a nurse for two weeks. It was in the gas­troen­terol­ogy de­part­ment of the lo­cal hos­pi­tal. To the sur­prise of ab­solutely no one, I was ex­actly as bad around hu­man suffer­ing and co­pi­ous amounts of in­ter­nal fluids en­ter­ing the ex­ter­nal world as you’d ex­pect from some­one with high dis­gust sen­si­tivity and an over­ac­tive sense of emo­tional em­pa­thy. One lady needed sponges in­serted 10 cm deep in her stom­ach wound. One man was afraid of nee­dles and could be heard scream­ing from half the rooms on the floor as nurses spent 30 min­utes at­tempt­ing to in­sert an IV into his hand. None of this is un­ex­pected, but ac­tu­ally see­ing how you re­spond to it in re­al­ity is quite differ­ent try­ing to guess.</p><p>I re­sponded by ex­pe­rienc­ing prodi­gious amounts of phan­tom pain and em­pathic res­o­nance till my brain melted.</p><p>Till I met this el­derly old lady there who was the sweet­est thing and I asked her if I could do my 3-day case study on her, where I’d in­ter­view her for an hour ev­ery day. She was the ab­solute pin­na­cle of grand­moth­erly wis­dom and warmth. And in re­turn, I kept her com­pany. Her hus­band and child had trag­i­cally passed away in re­cent years. No one else came to visit. Our con­ver­sa­tions were an oa­sis in our day. We held hands while we talked about her youth, her fam­ily, and the joys of life as she had found it. Her mind was sharp. Her eyes were clear. But when I came back on the third day, her bed was empty—she had passed away from liver can­cer that night.</p><p>I went home, lay down in bed and cried.</p><p>I also con­cluded I wasn’t cut out to be a doc­tor. But then I thought, maybe I could still be a sur­geon in­stead. There was a sec­ond part to the pre-med track. A two week course at the morgue. Maybe that was my call­ing.</p><p>So I walked into the morgue where in­di­vi­d­ual hu­man body parts were sorted in IKEA-es­que plas­tic con­tain­ers: three in­testines here, five livers there, and oh, an en­tire ca­daver un­der that tarp.</p><p>I stood in shock.</p><p>For 40 min­utes straight.</p><p>The cool thing of go­ing in to shock around mul­ti­ple doc­tors who have seen it all be­fore is that they just let you stand there undis­turbed. I think I didn’t close my mouth or move a mus­cle the en­tire time I stood frozen in the mid­dle of the morgue. I watched as one stu­dent stud­ied a length of hu­man in­testines and re­marked that the end bit was tremen­dously squishy and flex­ible. She then pro­ceeded to sock pup­pet it in mock di­alogue to the stu­dent next to her. They both burst out laugh­ing be­fore re­turn­ing to their stud­ies.</p><p>“Th­ese are born sur­geons,” I re­al­ized “Some minds are made for cer­tain tasks.”</p><p>My mind on the other hand was made to be shuffled out of the morgue af­ter an hour, handed a glass of wa­ter, and then plopped on my bike.</p><p>Suffice to say, I didn’t be­come a sur­geon ei­ther.</p><p>I tried other things though.</p><p>I tried teach­ing. It was great, but I dreaded go­ing over roughly the same ma­te­rial year af­ter year.</p><p>I stud­ied eco­nomics, philos­o­phy, math, biol­ogy, Span­ish, an­thro­pol­ogy, psy­chopathol­ogy, neu­ro­science, and art.</p><p>I looked into ma­te­rial en­g­ineer­ing, in­dus­trial de­sign, 3D art, writ­ing, and char­ity work build­ing schools in poor coun­tries.</p><p>But in the end I picked video games, cause I kept <i>play­ing</i> video games.</p><p>Now play­ing games and de­vel­op­ing games are two very differ­ent ac­tivi­ties—I know. So I read through the en­tire em­ployee list of var­i­ous game com­pa­nies and tried to imag­ine which role would suit me. De­signer? Pro­gram­mer? Artist? Sound Eng­ineer?</p><p>I tried out each one ask­ing my­self which po­si­tion would be my call­ing. I drafted de­sign docs, poked game en­g­ines, sketched dream wor­lds, and dis­cov­ered au­di­tory dyslexia does not proffer a com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage in sound en­g­ineer­ing.</p><p>All these roles made for in­timi­dat­ing goals. Game de­vel­oper po­si­tions are as sought af­ter as Hol­ly­wood jobs. So I took a step back and asked my­self if it re­ally mat­tered <i>which </i>of the roles I ended up with. I re­al­ized the thing that mat­tered to me was “work on a cool game” while “figure out how to do that” could be a work in progress as I went along.</p><p>So I set the <i>di­rec­tion</i> of get­ting any job in the video game in­dus­try con­tribut­ing to the de­vel­op­ment of a AAA video game ti­tle. This was my 10 year pro­ject.</p><p>And 10 years later I got hired as a Data Scien­tist at Square Enix, where I an­a­lyzed data from Tomb Raider, Just Cause, Deus Ex, Life is Strange, and Hit­man. My re­ports went to pro­duc­ers and de­sign­ers, who then in­te­grated the in­for­ma­tion in their de­ci­sion pro­cess on how to de­velop these fran­chises fur­ther.</p><p>I didn’t know that job ex­isted when I started out. I didn’t know I’d be par­tic­u­larly suited for it ei­ther. And yet I made it. Us­ing this <s>one sim­ple trick</s> en­tirely con­voluted set of heuris­tics that hap­pen to work for my brain.</p><h1>Do what you love but always tie it back</h1><p>When I came up with all this stuff, I was very tired of fight­ing my brain. I was in col­lege, ab­solutely amaz­ing at forc­ing my­self to do stuff I hated, and ex­actly the level of tor­tured you’d ex­pect to see as a re­sult. Then I de­cided life just sucked too much that way, and I’d rather do stuff I want to be do­ing and risk it be­ing dumb than live out my life like that.</p><p>Hon­estly, I was a lit­tle bit grander about the whole thing. I re­al­ized I wanted to figure out how a Shoshan­nah-shaped brain can end up do­ing uniquely Shoshan­nah-shaped stuff, and ba­si­cally ex­plore the part of re­al­ity and pos­si­bil­ity space that can only be ex­plored by some­one with my ex­act brain and cir­cum­stances.</p><p>This logic can ap­ply to ev­ery­one. You are the only per­son who ever lived and will ever live who can ex­plore what it’s like to do stuff ex­actly <i>your</i> way, with <i>your</i> brain, and get the ex­act re­sults <i>you</i> will get.</p><p>So I stared at my brain and no­ticed I had a bunch of <i>nat­u­ral</i> mo­ti­va­tions. Things I wanted to do to farm re­ward sig­nals for my­self—the mo­ti­va­tional equiv­a­lents of a per­petuum mo­bile. What could I do with these?</p><p>Ex­ploit them!</p><p class="imgonly"><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6640d3e-00d1-47cb-a02e-ce4c6efd30e8_1428x836.png"><div class="imgonly"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uwmFSaDMprsFkpWet/nh9hocidkhbwlnsnqigg" /></div></a></p><p>So imag­ine the red arc is your di­rec­tion and the green ball is you. The ar­row is your “com­pass” and the or­ange balls are <s>dis­trac­tions</s> your nat­u­ral in­ter­ests—all the things you find your­self do­ing if left to your own de­vices with not a care in the world. This is the stuff that in­trin­si­cally mo­ti­vates you. The stuff that has you mov­ing with­out effort. The stuff that seeps into ev­ery minute of ev­ery day if you let it.</p><p>Now here are mine:</p><p class="imgonly"><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feab5220d-d762-4a57-b5d4-4cd074ca2b81_1456x816.jpeg"><div class="imgonly"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uwmFSaDMprsFkpWet/rcsu2ifwcbyn3qlgp732" /></div></a></p><p>I love to so­cial­ize, to read, to write, to learn new things, to draw, work out, and logic hard about stuff. Hon­estly, I love to play around as well, es­pe­cially in video games. But that was my di­rec­tion already so that didn’t count as a <s>dis­trac­tion</s> com­pet­ing in­ter­est I was look­ing to wran­gle into my grand life plan.</p><p>So how does the ac­tual wran­gling work?</p><p>Sim­ple—for ev­ery ac­tivity you nat­u­rally want to do, try to figure out a way to ap­ply it to your di­rec­tion. Your di­rec­tion is sort of like a <i>theme</i>—if your di­rec­tion is X and your in­ter­est is Y, then go do X-fla­vored Y-things.</p><p>I <i>sus­pect</i> this works for brains that are not mine. But ei­ther way, here are ex­am­ples of how I did it:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Draw­ing</strong>: Buy game art books, study con­cept art and 3D mod­el­ing, watch mak­ing-of videos of video game artists, learn the ba­sics of color the­ory and com­po­si­tion, ex­plore vi­su­ally artis­tic games.</p></li><li><p><strong>Work­ing Out</strong>: Gamefy all my work­outs, cre­ate my own re­wards and coun­ters, cre­ate phys­i­cal games for my friends, play video games with work­out el­e­ments, and imag­ine how to de­sign games that truly cap­ture the joy of var­i­ous work­outs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Logic</strong>: Learn pro­gram­ming, poke around in game en­g­ines, cre­ate di­a­grams of game de­sign el­e­ments, play games that are logic-heavy, study game the­ory (not the same thing, but re­ally much more rele­vant than peo­ple make it out to be!)</p></li><li><p><strong>Writ­ing</strong>: Write a blog about the psy­chol­ogy of video games (that’s the one that got picked up by the MIT Me­dia Lab), chat a lot with peo­ple about games, write scripts for my youtube videos about games, put game re­views on red­dit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Learn­ing New Fields</strong>: For each new topic I stud­ied I would re­flect on how it can be re­lated to video games. E.g., af­ter a class on eco­nomics, I checked out the me­chan­ics of Eve On­line, when study­ing philos­o­phy I looked into con­cep­tual rep­re­sen­ta­tion in video games, when ex­plor­ing biol­ogy or chem­istry I’d try to think about how the same top­ics could be taught or simu­lated with games.</p></li><li><p><strong>Read­ing</strong>: Trans­form much of my me­dia and liter­a­ture diet into game-rele­vant ma­te­rial like Dun­geons and Dragons books, isekai sto­ries, video game blogs, books on video game de­sign, and some of the fic­tion that many de­sign­ers used as source ma­te­rial.</p></li><li><p><strong>So­cial­iz­ing/​Or­ga­niz­ing</strong>: Fo­cus on ex­pand­ing my so­cial play by join­ing and then cre­at­ing a clan, start­ing my own youtube chan­nel, and later set­ting up a gam­ing data col­lec­tion cam­paign (which un­ex­pect­edly turned in to my PhD).</p></li></ul><p>Was that enough to fulfill my 10-year plan of con­tribut­ing to AAA video games?</p><p>Not en­tirely.</p><p>I still got stuck some­times. When I couldn’t come up with a pro­ject, or I re­ally needed to find a job but noth­ing seemed rele­vant, or I was un­happy with the thing I was do­ing but didn’t know what to do in­stead. I’d look for ad­vice, or try to rea­son through my prob­lems. But some­times that didn’t work ei­ther.</p><h1>When all else fails, ap­ply ran­dom search</h1><p>I first used ran­dom search as a col­lege stu­dent be­cause I was ac­tu­ally tremen­dously and ob­struc­tively <i>un­happy. </i>I had tried sleep­ing more, ex­er­cis­ing fre­quently, eat­ing healthier, med­i­tat­ing deeply, ask­ing for help, get­ting a med­i­cal check up, spend­ing more time with friends, do­ing vol­un­teer work, soak­ing up more sun­light, and ev­ery other self-help, self-care, and self-im­prove­ment tech­nique on the face of the earth.</p><p>And I still felt ter­rible.</p><p>So ei­ther there was no way to feel bet­ter, or the way to feel bet­ter lay in the space of ac­tions I had never tried be­fore.</p><p>And thus, I set out to try one new thing ev­ery day, for 30 days. The new thing could take 30 sec­onds, 3 min­utes, or 3 hours. It didn’t mat­ter. All that mat­tered was that it was some­thing I hadn’t tried be­fore. I would de­cide on the day what it would be—Some­times it was a whim. Some­times it was a pro­ject. All of it was new.</p><p>Things I tried in­cluded …</p><ul><li><p>Eat­ing a new fruit</p></li><li><p>Ex­plor­ing a new part of the city</p></li><li><p>Teach­ing my­self cartwheels</p></li><li><p>Read­ing about a new topic</p></li><li><p>Talk­ing to a new person</p></li><li><p>Climb­ing a new tree</p></li><li><p>Draw­ing on my window</p></li><li><p>Writ­ing a new fic­tion story</p></li><li><p>Try­ing a new figure draw­ing method</p></li><li><p>At­tend­ing my first yoga class</p></li><li><p>Buy­ing bal­loons and ran­domly hand­ing them out in the street</p></li></ul><p>Was I hap­pier af­ter those 30 days?</p><p>Yeah. Sort of. Not su­per happy. But a bit.</p><p>Some things worked. Some things I still do to this day. I ap­par­ently like eat­ing ba­nanas. I like climb­ing ran­dom ob­jects. I like meet­ing new peo­ple. Mostly I dis­cov­ered that <i>nov­elty in it­self</i> ac­tu­ally makes me hap­pier and is a nu­tri­ent I can be­come low on, and this can make me sad.</p><p>I think the ran­dom search did some­thing else as well though: It gave me prac­tice in just <i>do­ing</i> stuff, and speci­fi­cally in do­ing <i>weird</i> stuff, and then also in notic­ing what the <i>genre</i> of weird stuff is that my brain likes to do.</p><p>But how did this help me move along in my life di­rec­tion?</p><p>I think it loos­ened me up, in­creased the Over­ton win­dow of what I felt was pos­si­ble, and made me feel I was free to do things in the world that I wanted—Like send­ing in my CV for a Lo­cal­iza­tion Tester job at Elec­tronic Arts the next month. They offered me the job at the end of the in­ter­view… if I was will­ing to move to Spain within three weeks. Some­how that didn’t seem stranger than ran­domly hand­ing out bal­loons in the city cause I felt like it. So I said yes.</p><p>My guess is that ran­dom search is a way to get your brain un­stuck. I think it’s similar to how artists may doo­dle to warm up be­fore a ses­sion. Or how peo­ple like to drink al­co­hol to dis­in­hibit them­selves. Ex­cept it ap­plies to all of life, and gets you look­ing at the world with a ques­tion mark on your brain, won­der­ing what tiny new thing you could do to­day.</p><p>Over­all, these were mostly sto­ries about my life, but the sto­ries illus­trate the les­sons I wish I had learned a lot ear­lier and a lot faster. Speci­fi­cally, if you don’t know what to do with your life, con­sider pick­ing a di­rec­tion in­stead of a goal, then em­brace your nat­u­ral mo­ti­va­tions, in­dulging them while bend­ing them to­ward your life di­rec­tion.</p><p>And when all else fails, ap­ply ran­dom search.</p>
