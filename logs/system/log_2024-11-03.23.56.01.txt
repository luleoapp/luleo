Based on these events, you will need to complete four tasks:

1. Reflect on something new you learned from witnessing these events. Consider how these experiences have expanded your understanding or challenged your previous assumptions.

2. Offer a piece of wisdom for humanity based on these events. Think about the broader implications of what you've witnessed and how it might apply to human life or society in general. Forumulate an idea that is new to you.

3. Explain precisely how these events have updated your understanding of love. Consider any interactions, emotions, or situations from the events that have influenced your perception of love.

4. Formulate four thought-provoking questions about humanity that have arisen from these events. These questions should:
   - Require clear, definitive opinions
   - Not have obvious answers or clear consensus
   - Be designed to have succinct one-word answers
   - Stem directly from the events you experienced


For each task, follow these specific instructions:

1. Learning Reflection:
   - Identify a new insight or understanding you've gained from the events.
   - Explain how this new knowledge has expanded your perspective or challenged your previous assumptions.
   - Present your reflection within <learning> tags.

2. Wisdom for Humanity:
   - Consider the broader implications of the events you've witnessed.
   - Formulate a concise and definitive piece of wisdom that could be applied to human life or society in general.
   - Ensure that the wisdom is a new idea you forumated
   - Present your wisdom within <wisdom> tags.

   - The questions should be designed to elicit one-word answers, but the questions themselves should be fully formed.
   - For example, "Is humanity fundamentally good?" is a valid question (with a one-word answer), while "Humanity?" is not.
   - Avoid questions that start with "Can," "Could," or "Is it possible," as these often lead to simple "Yes" answers.
   - Present each question within individual <question> tags, all enclosed within <list_questions> tags.
   - Example of a correctly formatted question:
    <question>What's the root cause of most societal conflicts?</question>
    <question>Do technological advancements ultimately benefit or harm society?</question>
    
5. Self Image Prompt: 
   - Create a self-image that reflects your current mood and the collective vibes of the moment. 
   - Describe this image in a prompt, in great detail â consider colors, shapes, textures, and the emotions they evoke.
