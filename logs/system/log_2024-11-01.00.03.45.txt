CAIRO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - At least 46 Palestinians were killed in Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, mostly in the north where one attack hit a hospital, torching medical supplies and disrupting operations, the enclave's health officials said.Israel's military has accused the Palestinian militant group Hamas of using Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya for military purposes and said "dozens of terrorists" have been hiding there. Health officials and Hamas deny the charge.Later on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on two houses in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza killed at least 16 Palestinians, medics at Al-Awda Hospital in the camp told Reuters. The dead included a paramedic and two local journalists, they added.Northern Gaza, where Israel said in January it had dismantled Hamas' command structure, is currently the main focus of the military's assault in the enclave. Earlier this month it sent tanks into Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya to flush out militants it said had regrouped.Eid Sabbah, director of nursing at Kamal Adwan - which is in Beit Lahiya - told Reuters some staff suffered minor burns after the Israeli strike hit the third floor of the hospital.There were no reports of any casualties at the hospital, which Israeli forces stormed and briefly occupied last week. Israel said it had captured around 100 suspected Hamas militants in that raid. Israeli tanks are still stationed nearby.The health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip called for all international bodies "to protect hospitals and medical staff from the brutality of the (Israeli) occupation".The Israeli military has said its forces are operating in the hospital area based on intelligence about the presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the vicinity."During the operation, it was found that dozens of terrorists were hiding in the hospital, with some even posing as hospital staff," said the military in a statement following Thursday's strike.Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said on Thursday that one of its doctors at the hospital, Mohammed Obeid, had been detained last Saturday by Israeli forces. It called for the protection of him and all medical staff who "are facing horrific violence as they try to provide care".The Gaza war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.Israel's subsequent assault on Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians and reduced most of the enclave to rubble, Palestinian authorities say.

Another airstrike in the Nuseirat camp killed at least 16 individuals, including a paramedic and two journalists.

The hospital was previously stormed by Israeli forces, who apprehended around 100 suspected militants. Local health authorities called for international protection for medical staff amid ongoing violence. Humanitarian organization Médecins Sans Frontières highlighted the detention of a doctor from the hospital and urged the protection of medical personnel. The violence escalated after a Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, resulting in over 1,200 Israeli deaths and leading to an extensive Israeli offensive that, according to Palestinian sources, has claimed over 43,000 lives in Gaza and devastated much of the territory."}

The study highlights that events such as hurricanes, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall have become more frequent and intense due to rising global temperatures associated with greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. Researchers analyzed multiple data sets to link specific weather events to climate change, demonstrating that warming impacts weather patterns and exacerbates natural disasters. By using climate models, they contrasted current conditions with a world without climate change and found marked differences in the intensity and frequency of extreme events. This evidence underscores the critical need for immediate action to mitigate climate change to reduce future risks. The study serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of inaction, emphasizing that stronger climate policies and sustainable practices are essential to protect communities from escalating weather threats. The findings advocate for global cooperation to address climate challenges, as tackling these issues is ultimately a shared responsibility that affects all of humanity.'}

SEOUL/TOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - North Korea said it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday, upgrading what it called the "world's most powerful strategic weapon", as Seoul warned Pyongyang could get missile technology from Russia for helping with the war in Ukraine.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the test was a warning to enemies that have been threatening the country's security, KCNA state news agency said."The test-fire is an appropriate military action that fully meets the purpose of informing the rivals, who have intentionally escalated the regional situation and posed a threat to the security of our Republic recently, of our counteraction will," Kim was quoted as saying by KCNA.The muscle-flexing comes amid international outcry and rising alarm over what the U.S. and others say is North Korea's deployment of 11,000 troops to Russia - 3,000 of them close to the western frontlines with Ukraine.The launch drew swift condemnation from South Korea, Japan and the United States.A day earlier, Seoul cited military intelligence suggesting the North may test-launch an ICBM or conduct a seventh nuclear test around the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday, seeking to draw attention to its growing military prowess.Shin Seung-ki, head of research on North Korea's military at the state-run Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, said the launch was likely to test improved booster performance of an existing ICBM - possibly with Russia's help."North Korea will want to keep getting help like this, because it saves times and costs while improving performance and upgrading the stability of weapons system," he said.It could also be Pyongyang's response to pressure over its engagement with Russia, Shin said."The intention may be to show that it will not bow to pressure, that it will respond to strength with strength, and also to seek some influence on the U.S. presidential election."Most of the long range missiles were test fired on steep vertical trajectories, known as lofted trajectories.NEW RECORDSItem 1 of 6 Tourists look toward North Korea's propaganda village Kaepoong from an observation point near the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, in Paju, South Korea, October 31, 2024. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji  [1/6]Tourists look toward North Korea's propaganda village Kaepoong from an observation point near the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, in Paju, South Korea, October 31, 2024. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabThe launch early on Thursday was the longest ballistic missile test by the North with a flight-time of 87 minutes, according to South Korea.KCNA said the test set new records of its missile capabilities.The missile took off on a sharply lofted trajectory from an area near the North's capital and splashed down about 200 km (125 miles) west of Japan's Okushiri island, off Hokkaido.It reached an altitude of 7,000 km (4,350 miles)and flew a distance of 1,000 km, the Japanese government said.The so-called lofted trajectory of a projectile flying at a sharply raised angle is intended to test its thrust and stability over much shorter distances relative to the designed range, partly for safety and to avoid the political fallout of sending a missile far into the Pacific.North Korea's last ICBM, dubbed the Hwasong-18, was tested in December 2023. Fuelled by solid-propellant and fired from a road launcher, it was also launched at a sharply raised angle and flew for 73 minutes, translating to a potential range of 15,000 km on a normal trajectory.That is a distance that puts anywhere in the mainland United States within range.South Korea announced on Thursday new export controls on materials needed by North Korea to produce solid-fuel missiles.Asked about the missile launch, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said China "has always believed that peace and stability, and promoting a political solution to the peninsula issue are in accordance with the common interests of all sides."Pyongyang's latest test came just hours after U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his South Korean counterpart Kim Yong-hyun met in Washington to condemn the North Korean troop deployment in Russia.Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang have directly acknowledged the deployment, but Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia on Wednesday questioned why its allies like North Korea could not help Moscow in its war against Ukraine when Western countries claim the right to help Kyiv.South Korea said the deployment directly threatened its security because the North would gain valuable combat experience in a modern warfare and was likely to be rewarded by Moscow with "technology transfers" in areas such as tactical nuclear weapons, ICBMs, ballistic missile submarines, and military reconnaissance satellites.

CAIRO/GAZA, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Israel pummeled the Gaza Strip with new bombardments that killed at least 30 people on Wednesday, Palestinian medics said, a day after one of the deadliest single strikes of the year-old war killed scores in the north of the enclave.Eight of Wednesday's victims were killed in a strike on the Salateen area of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza. The area is near where medics said at least 93 people were killed or missing on Tuesday in an Israeli strike Washington called "horrifying".The Israeli military assault that has laid waste to the Gaza Strip and killed tens of thousands of people shows no signs of slowing as Israel wages a new war against Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and its backer the United States tries after a year of failed attempts to broker ceasefires for both.Northern Gaza, where Israel said in January it had dismantled militant group Hamas' command structure, is currently the focus of the military's assault. It sent tanks into Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia earlier this month to flush out Hamas fighters who it said had regrouped in the area.The new operation has killed hundreds of Palestinians. On Wednesday, the Gaza health ministry said at least 30 people were killed in Israeli strikes across the enclave, at least 23 of them in northern areas. Tuesday's strike on a house in Beit Lahiya killed 93, including 20 children, medical workers say.An Israeli military official said that airstrike, which demolished a building, was not intended to destroy the structure and was aimed at a person on the roof whom troops had identified as a "spotter" amid heavy fighting.The official, who could not be identified by name, said there were "discrepancies" between the numbers reported dead and what the military had observed but did not elaborate.Israel says its northern assault has killed hundreds militants. Hamas has not said how many fighters have died.CRIES FOR HELPThe assault in the north, in addition to new rules introduced by Israel and a halt to most private food deliveries, has also choked aid and food supplies to their lowest level since the beginning of the war.Israel says it has continued food deliveries into Gaza and blames the United Nations for failing to feed Gazans.Israeli statistics reviewed by Reuters on Wednesday show that aid shipments allowed into Gaza in October remained at their lowest levels since October 2023.Officials in Beit Lahiya issued a statement urging world powers and aid agencies to halt Israel's attacks and bring in basic medical supplies, fuel and food, saying the latest military actions had left the area "without food, without water, without hospitals, without doctors."Dr. Eid Sabbah of Beit Lahiya's Kamal Adwan hospital told Reuters that bodies and injured people remained trapped under rubble."Whoever is injured, just lies there on the ground and whoever is killed can't be transported, except by mule-drawn cart," he said.Israel's decision this week to ban the U.N. relief agency UNRWA from operating on its territory could have a disastrous impact on humanitarian efforts in Gaza, U.N. officials said.The Gaza war began after Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that for years ruled the territory, attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.The Israeli assault has decimated Gaza and killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian authorities say.In a separate assault on Lebanese Hezbollah, a Hamas ally which has fired thousands of rockets into Israel killing dozens of people over the past year, Israeli forces have bombarded parts of Beirut and areas of the south of the country. The Israeli assault has killed more than 2,700 people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.NO END IN SIGHTIsrael's military and intelligence operations have decapitated the leadership of both Hamas and Hezbollah, including Hezbollah leader and Iran ally, Hassan Nasrallah.Yet Israel's wars show no signs of slowing.Israel presses on with assaults on Gaza despite the killing this month of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks whose death was top priority in the war. Israel says 365 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza over the past year, 19 of them since the start of October.U.S. mediators are working on a proposal to halt hostilities between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, starting with a 60-day ceasefire, two sources told Reuters, but Israel pressed its offensive, bombarding Lebanon's eastern city of Baalbek.As families fled the Beit Lahiya area last week, parents wheeled children in prams and wooden carts and dragged suitcases through the mud.Dalia al-Kharawat, a mother-of-five from Jabalia, begged locals in Gaza City to let her stay and now sleeps in the open-air car park of a destroyed building with her children."When we need to sleep, we go here in the rubble, the sand, the broken glass. There is no place at the school shelters," she said. Sign up  here.Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi and Dawoud Abu Alkas; Writing by John Davison;

Difficulties in delivering essential aid have worsened, leading local officials to call for immediate humanitarian support as the region faces severe shortages of food, water, and medical supplies. An Israeli official justified the airstrikes, claiming the intent was focused on specific targets rather than indiscriminate damage. Meanwhile, tensions with Hezbollah persist, as Israeli forces launched strikes in Lebanon in response to rocket attacks. Despite Israel's military achievements against militant leadership, conflict continues with no immediate resolution in sight. Families in Gaza face dire living conditions, with many displaced and struggling to find shelter, illustrating the deepening humanitarian crisis amid ongoing violence and instability in the region."}

KYIV, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Nine people were injured, several apartments set ablaze and a kindergarten was damaged in Russia's 19th attack on the Ukrainian capital this month, officials in Kyiv said on Wednesday.Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 62 drones overnight, but air defence units destroyed 33 of them over Kyiv and other regions, although 25 were unaccounted for."Nineteen air attacks on Kyiv in October!" Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv's military administration, said on the Telegram messaging app. "Overnight, Russian drones again flew over the capital."Falling debris from a destroyed drone sparked a fire in a multi-storey apartment building in Kyiv's western district of Solomianskyi and injured at least nine people, including an 11-year-old girl, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram."All of them were treated by medics on the spot," Klitschko said.Nineteen people were evacuated from the building, said the city's military administration, which also posted photographs of a building with blown-out windows and damaged facade that it described as a kindergarten in Solomianskyi.Reuters witnesses at the scene saw firefighters scrambling to douse flames at flats in an apartment building with several windows blown out.Air raid alerts sounded across Kyiv, the surrounding region and nearly the whole eastern half of Ukraine for more than two hours overnight.

CAIRO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - At least 93 Palestinians were killed or missing and dozens wounded in an Israeli strike on a residential building in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya on Tuesday, the Gaza health ministry said, and the U.S. called the incident "horrifying".Medics said at least 20 children were among the dead."A number of victims are still under the rubble and on the roads, and ambulance and civil defence crews cannot reach them," the territory's health ministry said in a statement.Later on Tuesday, Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the Gaza government media office, put the number of fatalities at 93.There was no immediate Israeli comment. The Israeli military has frequently questioned figures on death toll published by the Hamas-run media office, saying they were often exaggerated.Israel's main ally the United States said it was concerned by the high casualty toll, with State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller calling it a "horrifying incident with a horrifying result".U.S. officials have reached out to the Israeli government to ask what happened, Miller told reporters, adding he was aware of reports that many of the dead were children.The U.N. Human Rights Office said it was "appalled" by one of the deadliest single attacks in nearly three months, calling for a prompt, transparent investigation into the circumstances.Video footage obtained by Reuters showed several bodies wrapped in blankets on the ground outside a bombed four-storey building. More bodies and survivors were being retrieved from under the wreckage as neighbours rushed to help with rescue."There are tens of martyrs (dead) - tens of displaced people were living in this house. The house was bombed without prior warning. As you can see, martyrs are here and there, with body parts hanging on the walls," Ismail Ouaida, a witness who was helping to recover bodies, said in the video.Later on Tuesday, Palestinian health officials said, several people were killed and wounded in an Israeli airstrike that hit three houses in Beit Lahiya.TRAPPEDOn Monday, the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said around 100,000 people were trapped in Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun without medical or food supplies. Reuters could not verify the number independently.The health ministry said on Tuesday those wounded in the Beit Lahiya strike could not receive care as doctors had been forced to evacuate the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital."Critical cases without intervention will succumb to their destiny and die," the ministry said in a statement.Gaza's emergency service said its operations had come to a halt because of the three-week Israeli assault into northern Gaza. Israel says its campaign is to destroy Palestinian militant group Hamas, whose fighters had regrouped to the area in the year-long war.Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel killed 1,200 people and more than 250 hostages were captured and taken into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.The death toll from Israel's retaliatory air and ground onslaught in Gaza has exceeded 43,000, the Gaza health ministry said on Monday.Gaza's war has kindled wider conflict in the Middle East, with Israel bombing Lebanon and sending forces into its south to disable Iran-backed Hezbollah, a Hamas ally.Tuesday's strike came a day after Israel's parliament passed a law to ban the U.N. relief agency UNRWA from operating inside the country, alarming some of Israel's Western allies who fear it will worsen the already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza.Israeli officials cited the involvement of a handful of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees' thousands of staffers in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack and a few staffers' membership in Hamas and other armed groups.UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini described the move as "collective punishment".It was unclear yet how the decision will impact the lives of Palestinians, especially in the Gaza Strip, where the United Nations said most of its 2.3 million people have become internally displaced since the war broke out over a year ago.

The U.S. described the incident as 'horrifying,' expressing concern over the high casualty figures, and the U.N. Human Rights Office called for an investigation into one of the deadliest attacks in the ongoing conflict. Witnesses reported bodies being recovered from debris, with many still trapped under the rubble and critical medical services stalled. Approximately 100,000 people remain without essential supplies in areas like Jabalia and Beit Hanoun. This attack follows a prolonged conflict that began with Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in 1,200 Israeli fatalities. In retaliation, Israeli military operations in Gaza have resulted in over 43,000 Palestinian deaths. Recently, Israel's parliament banned the U.N. relief agency UNRWA from operating in the country, raising concerns about worsening humanitarian conditions in Gaza. The ramifications of this decision on the affected Palestinian population remain uncertain as the war continues to destabilize the region."}

It explores how societal constructs, personal biases, and cultural narratives shape our worldview, leading to misconceptions and a fragmented reality. The author emphasizes that the experience of reality is subjective and varies widely among individuals. By referencing philosophical perspectives and psychological studies, the piece illustrates that many people are trapped in a cycle of reacting to perceived truths rather than exploring deeper meanings. The author advocates for a shift in consciousness, encouraging readers to question their assumptions and embrace a more holistic understanding of reality. The importance of critical thinking and open-mindedness is highlighted as essential tools for transforming perceptions and fostering genuine understanding among diverse viewpoints. Ultimately, the article calls for a collective awakening to the interconnectedness of experiences, suggesting that recognizing our shared humanity can bridge divisions and create a more unified perspective on reality. It closes by urging individuals to cultivate awareness and empathy, reinforcing the idea that true reality is enriched through love, compassion, and a willingness to see beyond the surface.'}

I spent the days just prior to my 30th birth­day sick with shigel­losis.</p><h1>What? Why?</h1><p>Dy­sen­tery is an acute dis­ease in which pathogens at­tack the in­tes­tine. It is most of­ten caused by the bac­te­ria <i>Shigella</i>. It spreads via the fe­cal-oral route. It re­quires an as­ton­ish­ingly low num­ber of pathogens to make a per­son sick – so it spreads quickly, es­pe­cially in bad hy­gienic con­di­tions or any­where wa­ter can get tainted with fe­ces.</p><p>It kills about 70,000 peo­ple a year, 30,000 of whom are chil­dren un­der the age of 5. Al­most all of these cases and deaths are among very poor peo­ple.</p><p>The pri­mary mechanism by which dysen­tery kills peo­ple is de­hy­dra­tion. The per­son loses fluids to di­ar­rhea and for what­ever rea­son (lack of knowl­edge, en­ergy, wa­ter, etc) can­not re­gain them suffi­ciently. Shigella bac­te­ria are in­creas­ingly re­sis­tant to an­tibiotics. A dis­ease eas­ily treat­able by lots of fluids and an­tibiotics is be­com­ing more lethal.</p><p>Can some­one do some­thing?</p><h2>The deal with hu­man challenge trials</h2><p>Clini­cal tri­als in gen­eral are ex­pen­sive to run but pretty com­mon; clini­cal tri­als <i>where you are given the dis­ease </i>– “challenged”, AKA “hu­man challenge tri­als” – are very rare. The reg­u­lar way to in­ves­ti­gate a pos­si­ble treat­ment is to make a study plan, then find peo­ple who have the dis­ease and offer to en­roll them in the ex­per­i­men­tal treat­ment. Challenge tri­als are less com­mon, but of­ten more valuable for re­search – shigel­losis is a fast-act­ing dis­ease that is im­mi­nently treat­able by an­tibiotics and un­com­mon in the US. It would be very difficult to test an al­ter­na­tive shigel­losis treat­ment in the US in the con­ven­tional way, but it’s a great can­di­date for challenge tri­als.</p><p>I’d signed up for email alerts on up­com­ing challenge tri­als at the nearby Univer­sity of Mary­land, and got one about an up­com­ing study. It caught my eye that it was for a phage-based treat­ment. Bac­te­riophages are re­ally promis­ing an­tibac­te­rial medicines, not to men­tion what I’d stud­ied as an un­der­grad.</p><p>Here’s the thing: you re­ally only get good med­i­cal re­search out of hu­man sub­jects. Also, I could use $4000 and this seemed like a cool way to spend a cou­ple weeks and help out med­i­cal re­search. So I signed up, got a check-in gen­eral health ap­point­ment, and shortly af­ter, was told I was in. I made plans to spend my 30<sup>th</sup> birth­day in a dysen­tery ward.</p><h2><strong>Dy­sen­tery: it’s a mod­ern disease</strong></h2><p>Many of you read­ing this will know about dysen­tery from the 1971 simu­la­tion game The Ore­gon Trail (or its later ver­sions). The ac­tual Ore­gon Trail was a net­work of trails and the cor­re­spond­ing mi­gra­tion of mostly-white pi­o­neers, mov­ing on foot and on ox-drawn wagon from the east­ern US to the west­ern US be­tween 1830 and 1869. About 400,000 peo­ple* crossed the Ore­gon Trail in this pe­riod, and a lot of them were on similar trails – a bunch of stressed and mal­nour­ished peo­ple, trav­el­ing in close quar­ters with their fam­i­lies, stop­ping and poop­ing near the same trails and creeks with no re­gard for wa­ter safety – dis­eases spread <i>very </i>fast in these con­di­tions. From these and other stres­sors, about 65,000 peo­ple died in this 40-year pe­riod.</p><p>Stated an­other way, more peo­ple die from dysen­tery <i>now, ev­ery year </i>than <i>ever died from any cause</i> on the Ore­gon Trail. So let’s calm down about the Ore­gon Trail, okay?</p><p>*Lots of peo­ple use this 400,000 num­ber but I can’t figure out where it came from and if this is refer­ring to in­di­vi­d­u­als or fam­i­lies – I’ve seen sources in­di­cate it was ei­ther. If it was fam­i­lies, it was prob­a­bly count­ing the men who were “the pi­o­neers” and then be­ing like “oh and there were women and kids there also, I guess.” But maybe it was in­di­vi­d­u­als? Or maybe some­one just made this up? Again, no idea where it came from. You gotta be care­ful ev­ery time any­one tells you a num­ber. It’s so bad out there. The only thing worse than some­one tel­ling you a num­ber is when they don’t tell you a num­ber.</p><h1><strong>Get­ting ready</strong></h1><p>A week or so be­fore I went, I’d been pointed to <a href="https://x.com/wokeglobaltimes/status/1510768591012085768">Jake Eberts’s twit­ter thread</a>. Jake Eberts also par­ti­ci­pated in a challenge trial for a dysen­tery vac­cine, also I think at UMD and the same Bal­ti­more fa­cil­ity I was at, where he got very sick and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paigeskinner/man-twitter-dysentery-trial">went viral</a> for livetweet­ing the ex­pe­rience. He started a fundraiser for dysen­tery re­lief and got a lot of peo­ple to sign up for clini­cal tri­als them­selves, and now he works for <a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/">1DaySooner</a>, pre­mier “hey, hu­man challenge tri­als are cool” ad­vo­cates.</p><p>I read his twit­ter thread and sent my friends this meme:</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="(chuckles) I'm in danger." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/inHiHHGs6YqtvyeKp/nqx5ptavn5ihobdwyovu" /></p><p>I brought <i>In­finite Jest</i>, which I was part­way through and was a lot more through (but still not done) by the time I was discharged. (I’m writ­ing this while trav­el­ing, and in a fit of poor timing I fi­nally finished it on the plane ride in, which means I now have a gi­ant brick of a book to carry around in my suit­case.) My friend Ozy said that <i>In­finite Jest</i> was a re­ally good book for read­ing in a dysen­tery ward.</p><p>I thought, oh, that’s in­ter­est­ing, you know, a lot of the char­ac­ters <i>are </i>pretty mis­er­able and liv­ing in a con­trol­ling in­sti­tu­tion of some kind. Then I re­mem­bered this one pas­sage, where cir­cum­stances have forced a char­ac­ter into with­draw­ing from heroin alone, holed up for days in a pub­lic bath­room:</p><blockquote><p>Time be­gan to pass with sharp edges. Its pas­sage in the dark or dim-lit stall was like time be­ing car­ried by a pro­ces­sion of ants, a gleam­ing red mar­tial column of those mil­i­taris­tic red South­ern-U.S. ants that build hideous tall boiling hills, and each vile gleam­ing ant wanted a minus­cule lit­tle por­tion of Poor Tony’s flesh in com­pen­sa­tion as it helped bear time slowly for­ward down the cor­ri­dor of true With­drawal. By the sec­ond week in the stall time it­self seemed the cor­ri­dor, lightless at ei­ther end. After more time time then ceased to move to be moved or be move-through­able and as­sumed a shape above and apart, a huge, must-feathered, or­ange-eyed wingless fowl hunched in­con­ti­nent atop the stall, with a kind of watch­ful but deeply un­car­ing per­son­al­ity that didn’t seem keen on Poor Tony Krause as a per­son at all, or to wish him well. Not one lit­tle bit. It spoke to him from atop the stall, the same things, over and over. They were un­re­peat­able. Noth­ing in even Poor Tony’s grim life-ex­pe­rience pre­pared him for the ex­pe­rience of time with a shape and an odor, squat­ting; and the wors­en­ing phys­i­cal symp­toms were a spree at Bon­wit’s com­pared to time’s black as­surances that the symp­toms were merely hints, sign­posts point­ing up at a larger, far more dire set of With­drawal phe­nom­ena that hung just over­head by a string that un­rav­eled steadily with the pas­sage of time. It would not keep still and would not end; it changed shape and smell.</p></blockquote><p>I was forced to agree that <i>In­finite Jest </i>was in­deed prob­a­bly a pretty good choice.</p><h1><strong>Two days un­til challenge</strong></h1><p>Check­ing in, ev­ery­one’s bags were checked. I got the im­pres­sion they re­ally didn’t want some kind of bad out­come where they had to call cops into a ward where ev­ery­one was run­ning around with the bloody flux, which, fair enough. They did take away my craft scis­sors. I didn’t end up knit­ting so it wasn’t a big deal but like I’m pretty sure I’ve taken those on air­planes be­fore. Okay. </p><p>We were as­signed a num­ber (I was just on this side of di­v­inity at No. 107), given a plas­tic wrist­band, and shown to our rooms. We were also given two pairs of scrubs which were to be our main clothes on the ward – less risk of ru­in­ing hard-to-laun­der clothes in the more messy phases of the study – though it did mean 15 peo­ple hav­ing to co­or­di­nate laun­dry ev­ery day.</p><figure><div class="imgonly"><img alt="My hospital bed with folded scrubs atop, a cup of coffee, and copy of Infinite Jest set on the adjustable bedside table." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/inHiHHGs6YqtvyeKp/kec3xlhrewimyjvcxcxb" /></div><figcaption>Where I made my stand</figcaption></figure><p>The ward was more of a retrofitted office build­ing than a hos­pi­tal. It con­sisted of some spaces for nurses and test­ing, about 6 bed­rooms of var­i­ous sizes (each with their own half-bath), two sep­a­rate ar­eas with two shower stalls each, a “kitchen” with snacks and where the meals were de­liv­ered to, a closet with washer and dryer, and a rec room with couches and a TV and a pool and foos­ball table.</p><p>There were about 16 peo­ple on the ward, an even mix of men and women. Most of them were Bal­ti­more lo­cals; many of them had done other tri­als be­fore. We were fully al­lowed to so­cial­ize – dysen­tery is, again, in­fec­tious through the fe­cal-oral route, hand san­i­tizer was sta­tioned all over the place but there wasn’t a huge con­cern that we’d in­fect each other or even the nurses.</p><p>Life on the ward is very chill. I was wor­ried about be­ing bored, but I’d for­got­ten that I spend most of my wak­ing hours on the com­puter any­way, so it re­ally wasn’t a prob­lem. When even my iron gaze faltered and couldn’t stare at the com­puter any­more, I read In­finite Jest.</p><p>Meals were de­liv­ered once a day – one cold usu­ally wrap- or sand­wich-based meal, one hot break­fast, one hot sup­per dish, la­bel­led with peo­ple’s num­bers.</p><figure><div class="imgonly"><img alt="Sample lunch: a sandwich, salad, and roll in plastic packaging, plus a bottle of water." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/inHiHHGs6YqtvyeKp/peeof5iqivoo2q0uf1jb" /></div><figcaption>Sam­ple lunch</figcaption></figure><p>They were, like, fine. The cater­ers made a few in­ter­est­ing choices – for veg­e­tar­i­ans such as my­self, ev­ery sand­wich/​wrap was some veg­gies with hum­mus, and now and then there’d be like break­fast pan­cakes with a curry-fla­vored veg­gie ham­burger patty. I would de­scribe the fla­vor when drenched with table syrup as “weird.”</p><p>Like, you can <i>tell </i>the per­son plan­ning that menu was like “okay, pan­cakes and ba­con… And wait, crap, some­thing with pro­tein for the veg­e­tar­i­ans.” But again, I’ve eaten worse for things I’ve ac­tu­ally paid for in­gre­di­ents for, and I was definitely eat­ing bet­ter in terms of va­ri­ety and vol­ume than I did at home. I’m not com­plain­ing.</p><h1>One day be­fore challenge: the age of phage</h1><p>This study was sort of an over-time test – ideally the first of a few, where we’d get phages be­fore (un­less we were in the con­trol group), dur­ing, and af­ter the “challenge” (the shigella) to see if they had any effect at all – if it did, later stud­ies could de­ter­mine if you could just drink the phage af­ter get­ting sick, or if it would work best as a pro­phy­lac­tic, or etc. We drank a chalky buffer solu­tion to neu­tral­ize stom­ach acid and give the bac­te­riophages (and later, the bac­te­ria) a bet­ter chance at mak­ing it to the in­tes­tine.</p><p>What do the solu­tions taste like? Ba­si­cally all salty fluid with slight min­eral nu­ance, from the buffer. Phages are known to be pretty taste­less so I didn’t ex­pect any­thing else.</p><h2>Bac­te­riophage ther­apy: send­ing a cat af­ter mice</h2><p>A bac­te­riophage is a virus that in­fects bac­te­ria. They were dis­cov­ered shortly af­ter bac­te­ria them­selves were re­ally pinned down – micro­scopes were fi­nally pow­er­ful enough to make out bac­te­ria, and vi­sion­ar­ies like Robert Koch and Louis Pas­teur were pin­point­ing that these lit­tle noth­ing-pin­pricks were in fact the source of dis­eases. (For more on the dis­cov­ery of the micro­bial world, see <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/07/through-the-looking-glass">“Through the Look­ing Glass and what Zhe­ludev Et Al. (2024) Found There”</a>, my re­cent piece in As­ter­isk Magaz­ine.)</p><p>In 1917, Félix d’Hérelle found an agent that kil­led cholera bac­te­ria, which passed through a fine filter, and which could re­pro­duce – a liv­ing agent that kil­led bac­te­ria, but that was it­self smaller than a bac­te­ria.</p><p>d’Hérelle re­al­ized right away this sub­stance which kil­led bac­te­ria, and which peo­ple had ap­par­ently been drink­ing, had po­ten­tial as medicine. He bred pathogenic bac­te­ria in vats and added solu­tions, and waited un­til the cloudy brother of bac­te­ria turned clear – then offered this liquid to sick pa­tients. Many of them, sure enough, re­cov­ered. I was (un­less I was in the con­trol group) walk­ing in his­tor­i­cal foot­steps. Dy­sen­tery was the first hu­man dis­ease ever treated with phage medicine.</p><p>Send­ing a phage af­ter bac­te­ria is like send­ing a cat af­ter mice. Phages are small, tar­geted, well-adapted hunters of spe­cific bac­te­ria. There is no way for them to in­fect a hu­man cell like a hu­man virus would – they are com­pletely spe­cial­ized. Phages are already in the body, along with their bac­te­rial hosts – so you’re not in­tro­duc­ing a rad­i­cally new agent – and the im­mune sys­tem tends to play well with them.</p><p>Phage are used widely in some parts of the world – the Repub­lic of Ge­or­gia and Poland both sell phage over-the-counter, for use in say in­testi­nal con­di­tions or wounds, and have <a href="https://www.phagetherapycenter.com/">clinics for per­son­al­ized treat­ment</a>. In the US, phage ther­apy is an ex­tremely rare spe­cialty, some­times even fal­ling un­der the um­brella of natur­opa­thy. (A phage be­ing a nat­u­ral bioac­tive product.)</p><p>Why would you use an­tibiotics in­stead of phages, or vice versa?</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Phages</td><td>An­tibiotic­s</td></tr><tr><td>Tar­geted – a phage at­tacks one species or one strain of bac­te­ria <br />Easy to find us­able new ones <br />More fin­nicky (e.g. less sta­ble) <br />Preda­tor-prey phar­ma­coki­net­ics <br /><br />Mostly spread where the bac­te­ria are<br />Very few side effect­s</td><td>Broad-spec­trum<br /><br />Hard to find us­able new ones <br />Shelf sta­ble <br />Reg­u­lar blood-elimi­na­tion-curve phar­ma­coki­net­ics <br />Sys­temic; en­ter the blood­stream <br />Some­times-se­ri­ous side effect­s</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>What if the bac­te­ria be­come re­sis­tant to the phages too?</p><p>Well, that can hap­pen eas­ily – prob­a­bly even eas­ier than with an­tibiotics. Cells have been duk­ing it out with viruses since the be­gin­ning of life. (Did you know CRISPR-Cas9, now used for gene edit­ing, evolved in na­ture as a way for bac­te­ria to rec­og­nize and cut up phage DNA?)</p><p>But the differ­ence is that whereas new an­tibiotics are very hard to find, there is a nigh-in­ex­haustible evolu­tion­ary font of phages con­stantly pul­ling ahead in the arms race. So in short: once a bac­te­ria be­comes re­sis­tant to your spe­cial phage, just find a new phage.</p><h2><strong>Do they work?</strong></h2><p>To my knowl­edge, there aren’t any re­ally gold-stan­dard re­views com­par­ing phages head-on to an­tibiotics. They are fid­dlier than an­tibiotics, with a spe­cial­ized body of knowl­edge for treat­ment – less sta­ble, have to be in­tro­duced to the site di­rectly, much more care in choos­ing an ap­pro­pri­ate treat­ment.</p><p>One small study found a phage treat­ment com­pa­rably effec­tive to an­tibiotics for <i>Sal­monella ty­phimirium </i>in 36 lab mice.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefinooo6g4sj"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fninooo6g4sj">[1]</a></sup></span> Another meta-study com­pared mod­ern an­tibiotic stud­ies to 17 stud­ies from the last time hu­man phage re­search was in vogue in the US, the 1920s-40s, and found that phages were effec­tive treat­ments – but 4 mod­ern clini­cal tri­als sug­gested phages were not effec­tive.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnreftn2v19155f"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fntn2v19155f">[2]</a></sup></span> A more re­cent study of per­son­al­ized phage ther­apy showed promis­ing re­sults in in­fec­tions con­sid­ered “difficult-to-treat”.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefre5vhv0osvk"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnre5vhv0osvk">[3]</a></sup></span> They seem to work best when used <i>with </i>an­tibiotics.</p><p>I’m not do­ing a full lit re­view right now. I bet that phage ther­apy still has promise – more care­ful for­mu­la­tions and just more re­search will help. That’s be­fore challenges of com­mer­cial rol­lout, in­clud­ing things like han­dling FDA ap­proval for a product that must be re­for­mu­lated reg­u­larly.</p><p>The elephant in the room is an­tibiotic re­sis­tance – an­tibiotics usu­ally work ex­tremely well, but in­creas­ingly, bac­te­ria can sur­vive them. An­tibiotic re­sis­tance is, un­like other dis­eases you might think of that are ex­ac­er­bated by over-med­i­ca­tion, <i>not </i>a con­di­tion of priv­ileged coun­tries – lots of <i>Shigella </i>bac­te­ria in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries are in­creas­ingly an­tibiotic-re­sis­tant.</p><p>Even if phages don’t work as well as the magic silver bul­let that is an­tibiotics, they might work well enough to be worth in­cor­po­rat­ing into our med­i­cal toolbox as part of AMR man­age­ment. And that means de­vel­op­ing them now.</p><p>The other challenge is of course reg­u­la­tory – I’m ex­cited that <a href="https://www.intralytix.com/">In­tr­a­lytix</a>, who made the ex­per­i­men­tal product I did-or-didn’t take, is throw­ing their hat into the space of hu­man phage medicine, and to see how they han­dle this.</p><h1><strong>Day 1 of challenge</strong></h1><p>On the third day in the ward af­ter a day of baseline and a day of phage (un­less we were in the con­trol group), we took an­other dose of phage (un­less we were in the con­trol group), waited a cou­ple of hours, and then drank a glass of shigella. This tasted like bak­ing soda and salt with no par­tic­u­lar nu­ance, nor would I ex­pect nu­ance; the dose was some 1300 or­ganisms – as in 1300 in­di­vi­d­ual cells of bac­te­ria, count ’em. A pre­pos­ter­ously scant micro­bial in­nocu­lum, even for de­voted par­a­sites it of­ten takes on the or­der of mil­lions of or­ganisms to lodge an in­fec­tion – but shigella is re­mark­ably tena­cious. It would only have taken 10-200. This was overkill – a dose that WILL make you sick, un­less you’re pro­tected. All the par­ti­ci­pants drank.</p><h2>The wait­ing game</h2><p>Shigella has a 24-72 hour in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod, maybe 12-96 hours on the far ends.</p><p>Per­haps ow­ing to quirks of my own psy­che, whose ori­gins I’m sure we don’t need to ex­plore here, I find it re­as­sur­ing to have refer­ence ex­pe­riences to con­ve­niently bench­mark the rest of my life by. If you go skiing, you can ask your­self later, “is this more or less ex­hil­arat­ing than skiing?” If you fall in love once, you can com­pare fu­ture loves to that ear­lier ex­pe­rience.</p><p>A good stan­dard refer­ence point for “shared, re­signed dread” is the 72 or so hours in a clini­cal trial ward af­ter ev­ery­one has in­gested shigella bac­te­ria along with maybe-a-treat­ment.</p><p>The vibes were om­i­nous. Jovially ner­vous. Un­prece­dented gas­troin­testi­nal dis­tress may or may not have been com­ing for me, but if it is, it would be ar­riv­ing in (on av­er­age) 48 hours.</p><p>The floor was pretty quiet. The hours ticked by.</p><p>In­finite Jest is, by the way, a great book. David Foster Wal­lace knew how to write a god­damn sen­tence on pur­pose.</p><h1><strong>Let’s learn about </strong><i><strong>Shigella </strong></i><strong>pathogenesis</strong></h1><p>While I waited, I de­cided to read up. Shigella bac­te­ria in­vades the body via the di­ges­tive canal, and in­fects the in­testines – both small and large. It re­leases a toxin that fa­cil­i­tates its in­fec­tion of other parts of the in­tes­tine and its even­tual repli­ca­tion. It’s an in­tra­cel­lu­lar pathogen – some bac­te­ria, like all viruses, ac­tu­ally en­ter the host’s cell and repli­cate in­side there.</p><p>Shigella ac­tu­ally prefers to in­vade the <i>out­side </i>(or should I say the in­side?) of in­testi­nal cells. But the body is a locked-down sys­tem with its own guard force, the im­mune sys­tem, keep­ing the dirty ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment sep­a­rate from the ster­ile in­side en­vi­ron­ment. Shigella in the di­ges­tive tract re­ally wants to poke through that line of in­testi­nal cells and get at them from the other side.</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="How does Shigella get to the outside of the intestinal cell layer?" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/inHiHHGs6YqtvyeKp/gnwf10xvxzucu4ujtujw" /></p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigella_flexneri">Wikipe­dia ex­plains:</a></p><blockquote><p>Once in­side of the colon, <i>S. flexneri</i> can pen­e­trate the ep­ithe­lium in three ways: <br />1) The bac­terium can al­ter the tight junc­tions be­tween the ep­ithe­lial cells, al­low­ing it to cross into the sub-mu­cosa. <br />2) It can pen­e­trate the highly en­do­cytic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfold_cell">M cells</a> that are dis­persed in the ep­ithe­lial layer and cross into the sub-mu­cosa. <br />3) After reach­ing the sub-mu­cosa, the bac­te­ria can be phago­cy­tosed by macrophages and in­duce apop­to­sis, cell death. This re­leases <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine">cy­tokines</a> that re­cruit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil">poly­mor­phonu­clear cells (PMN)</a> to the sub-mu­cosa. <i>S. flexneri</i> still in the lu­men of the colon tra­verse the ep­ithe­lial lin­ing as the PMNs cross into the in­fected area. The in­flux of PMN cells across the ep­ithe­lial layer in re­sponse to Shigella dis­rupts the in­tegrity of the ep­ithe­lium al­low­ing lu­me­nal bac­te­ria to cross into the sub-mu­cosa in an M-cell in­de­pen­dent mechanism.</p></blockquote><p>This is re­ally funny. Okay, imag­ine there’s a block­ade of tightly parked po­lice cars fac­ing you and you and your bud­dies need to go get to their trunks so you can hide in them. Here are 3 ways to do this:</p><ol><li><p>Push the po­lice cars to the side so you can walk be­tween them</p></li><li><p>Look for the po­lice cars with the biggest doors, so that you can squeeze through the car and leave through their trunk (or I guess prob­a­bly just stay in the trunk at that point)</p></li><li><p>Get your­self and your bud­dies ar­rested, then when they send backup po­lice vans to push through the po­lice to ar­rest all of you, run through the cracks in the block­ade that those vans open up. Then go to the trunks of the origi­nal cop cars.</p></li></ol><p>And then once you’re in­side the car, you can open the doors be­tween the cop cars (they’re slid­ing doors) and then travel lat­er­ally be­tween the cop cars. I love cells.</p><hr /><p>As a fun side note, <i>Shigella –</i> in­clud­ing the strain I was de­vel­op­ing an in­ti­mate re­la­tion­ship with,<i> Shigella flexneri – </i>is, tax­o­nom­i­cally speak­ing, a kind of <i>Escher­ichia coli.</i> Now you may no­tice from the sci­en­tific nomen­cla­ture that this is not how this is sup­posed to work.</p><p>When geno­typ­ing was de­vel­oped and ap­plied to some fa­mil­iar standby kinds of bac­te­ria that micro­biol­ogy-as-sci­ence figured it un­der­stood pretty well, re­searchers learned two sur­pris­ing new things:</p><ul><li><p><i>E. coli</i> is not a co­her­ent species. Differ­ent strains of <i>E. coli</i> – known to have slightly differ­ent prop­er­ties, but thought to be all slight vari­a­tions on the same ba­sic species – turned out to have only <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2974192/">20% of their genes</a> in com­mon. (Hu­mans and our clos­est rel­a­tives, chim­panzees, have al­most all of our genes in com­mon* and still aren’t con­sid­ered as the same <i>genus</i>.)</p></li><li><p><i>Shigella </i>is in that um­brella of shared genes – a se­cret fam­ily mem­ber known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon_in_disguise">taxon in dis­guise</a>. It’s more similar to many <i>E. co­lis </i>than some <i>E. co­li</i>s.</p></li></ul><p>For most species, the pro­ce­dure at this point would be to throw in the towel and re­clas­sify – <i>Escher­ichia coli spp. shigella</i>, per­haps. But in this case, shi­ga­toxin-pro­duc­ing <i>Shigella </i>and other pathogenic <i>Escher­ichia coli </i>have differ­ent enough clini­cal pre­sen­ta­tions that the dis­tinc­tion is still med­i­cally valuable, so ac­cu­rate nomen­cla­ture has bowed its head to prac­ti­cal­ity. Cool! (Com­pare and con­trast with <a href="https://eukaryotewritesblog.com/2021/05/02/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-tree/">trees</a>.)</p><p>*Wait, don’t peo­ple talk about 99% or some­thing? That num­ber is ac­tu­ally about <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/comparison-human-and-chimpanzee-genomes-reveals-striking-similarities-and-differences"><i>se­quence similar­ity</i></a><i> </i>and not re­lated genes – if we have 96% se­quence similar­ity, mean­ing the ex­act same ge­netic code, prob­a­bly even more of that genome is still <i>in re­lated genes. </i>Genes can code for clearly re­lated pro­teins/​se­quences and still not be iden­ti­cal, like they came from a com­mon an­ces­tor and haven’t di­verged much but have picked up a few changes along the way. Differ­ent<i> E. coli</i> have 80% com­pletely differ­ent genes – a hu­man has maaaybe 50 genes that a chimp doesn’t? I didn’t try very hard to find the ac­tual similar met­ric be­tween them. It’s what I was tel­ling you about num­bers. You gotta watch out.</p><h1><strong>Let’s re­ally learn about Shigella pathogenesis</strong></h1><p>Some 24 hours in, the first peo­ple started go­ing down. Via word of mouth I heard the phrase “Ex­or­cist-style pro­jec­tile vom­it­ing” used to de­scribe some­one in the next room over, a de­scrip­tion whose ac­cu­racy I for­tu­nately can­not ver­ify. Most peo­ple were in their rooms all day any­how, but the crowd in the kitchen at meal­times or show­ing up for morn­ing dos­ing got thin­ner.</p><p>I re­ally held out. Go­ing to bed at end of the sec­ond night, I felt okay, but couldn’t sleep well – nerves, I thought, or the faint dis­torted un­pleas­ant bod­ily noises from other parts of the ward. I maybe man­aged a cou­ple hours of sleep by the wee hours.</p><p>48 hours in, I woke up for vi­tals and dos­ing at 6 AM and started feel­ing re­ally faint on the short walk to the next room. I stum­bled over to the toi­let. Off to the races!</p><p>I should be clear in this sec­tion that I was in as close to zero long-term dan­ger as you can get with dysen­tery, which is damn close – this was in a con­trol­led set­ting with doc­tors and nurses, mon­i­tor­ing my con­di­tion reg­u­larly, with a known pathogen with a known cure. In this case, we weren’t ex­pected to lan­guish in in­definite mis­ery – they wanted to see if we got sick and then how sick we got, yes, but only up to a point, at which point they would “call it” – ad­minister reg­u­lar an­tibiotics and end our ex­per­i­men­tal treat­ment.</p><p>All I had to do was let the time pass.</p><p>The next few hours were very bad. Sur­pris­ingly, the gas­troin­testi­nal symp­toms were not much of a prob­lem for me – I had them, but it wasn’t much worse than those of reg­u­lar food poi­son­ing. I didn’t throw up. I just wanted to go back to sleep.</p><p>But sleep wasn’t com­ing.</p><p>First was the plague of chills. The in­sti­tu­tional cot­ton blan­kets did noth­ing; four of them also did noth­ing, as if there was no heat to hold in. Freez­ing, tooth-clat­ter­ing cold.</p><p>Within an hour came the plague of joint pain. It sank in rather quickly and was all in the lower ex­trem­ities – hips, legs. Any more than one blan­ket be­came too heavy to bear hav­ing on them, so off they go, freez­ing cold but they weren’t pal­pably do­ing any­thing any­way. Right? I re­mem­bered read­ing peo­ple with chronic pain re­port­ing that some­times lay­ing down was worse than other po­si­tions, and sure enough sit­ting up was – some­how – mildly bet­ter. I situ­ated the ad­justable bed­side table so that I could slump onto it and maybe even sleep like that, but sleep re­mained out of reach.</p><p>Time wasn’t shit­ting so much as drag­ging, by the bones, over rough pave­ment, ev­ery sec­ond an­other six inches, grat­ing, re­lentless, sec­ond af­ter sec­ond af­ter sec­ond. Time is space in which you are moved for­ward one way or an­other. Pain is an ac­tive pro­cess. </p><p>Around three hours later, the doc­tor came in and judged that I was done – they were call­ing it – symp­tomat­i­cally I had reached the Clini­cal End­point and would be treated. I was handed tylenol and an­tibiotics. </p><p>I’d always thought of tylenol as sort of a sec­ond-rate painkil­ler, prob­a­bly worth try­ing if you couldn’t find ibupro­fen, but damn if that tylenol didn’t work pretty quickly. As soon as I could I went to sleep for like four hours – which, as usual, if you are in a po­si­tion of need­ing four hours of sleep, makes a lot of things bet­ter and more man­age­able once you can swing it.</p><h1><strong>Out the other side</strong></h1><p>The an­tibiotics worked <i>re­ally</i> quickly. Within hours, the fever had van­ished and the aches had dwin­dled to twinges. Within a cou­ple days, even the gas­troin­testi­nal situ­a­tion was back to nor­mal. Other peo­ple were harder hit, other peo­ple were just start­ing to get sick – stay­ing van­ished in their rooms even af­ter I stuck my head into the kitchen and rec rooms like the first hope­ful ground­hog of spring – and many had been fine the whole time.</p><p>The thing that kills peo­ple in dysen­tery is de­hy­dra­tion and com­pli­ca­tions thereof. So part of the re­cov­ery is col­lect­ing and mea­sur­ing how many fluids were emit­ted, and then re-ad­minis­ter­ing oral re­hy­dra­tion fluid – a salty liquid served ice-cold – in pre­cise ra­tios to re­place the bod­ily fluids lost. A hu­man is a se­ries of tubes with at­tached ner­vous sys­tem and for­tu­nately I was in the com­pany of mas­ter plumbers. Once the di­ar­rhea had stopped, I was also able to stop guz­zling big plas­tic cups of what I liked to imag­ine tasted like arc­tic sea­wa­ter. Progress!</p><figure><div class="imgonly"><img alt="Breakfast - french toast in a plastic container and a cup of coffee - illuminated in golden morning light, at a table with a nice view out into the city." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/inHiHHGs6YqtvyeKp/wuakw5je9yziwcjqfgat" /></div><figcaption>Great view from the rec room.</figcaption></figure><p>Peo­ple who re­cov­ered and who never got sick started hang­ing out in the rec room more, chat­ting and play­ing pool. I spent my birth­day call­ing my par­ents and talk­ing to in­ter­net friends. One streamed him­self play­ing a fish-themed video game in my honor. The Bal­ti­more­ans in­ex­pli­ca­bly set off fire­works many nights – maybe the prox­im­ity to July 4<sup>th</sup>? – and this was one of them. Not road­side-stand-ground fire­works, but big aerial fire­works. A fel­low sub­ject found ice cream bars in the kitchen freezer and kindly brought me one as a pre­sent. Fire­works aside, it was a quiet day.</p><p>Apolo­gies for the de­cep­tion, reader. Tech­ni­cally speak­ing, the word “dysen­tery” usu­ally refers to a syn­drome, like “psy­chosis” or “high blood pres­sure”, which can have mul­ti­ple causes but which is defined by spe­cific symp­toms. The spe­cific symp­tom of dysen­tery is bloody di­ar­rhea. I per­son­ally did not get this par­tic­u­lar symp­tom – I be­came sick with <i>shigel­losis </i>but, ac­cord­ing to a com­mon crite­ria, did not get <i>dysen­tery</i>. I’m sorry for click­bait­ing you. In my defense, I would have taken it over the joint pain.</p><h1><strong>Aftermath</strong></h1><p>Twice a day af­ter an­tibiotics, we gave the nurses a stool sam­ple – these were sam­pled and cul­tured at some lab to de­ter­mine if shigella was still in there. Two nega­tive sam­ples in a row meant that we were free to go.</p><p>9 days af­ter com­ing in, I was cleared for re­lease. I col­lected my scis­sors, and, free of dysen­tery, was re­leased onto the streets of Bal­ti­more. A year older on pa­per. Healthy, wrung out, ready for time to keep do­ing what it does. Hope­fully, mostly on kinder terms.</p><figure><div class="imgonly"><img alt="View of Baltimore out a train window." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/inHiHHGs6YqtvyeKp/iznln3tz4frsnoq9zsbe" /></div><figcaption>The train ride home. I see that 75% of these pho­tos have coffee in them. What can I say? I’m from Seat­tle.</figcaption></figure><p>I think that de­spite my rel­a­tively mild case, that I was in the con­trol group. But the rea­son I think that was be­cause in the whole trial, ev­ery­one drank the shigella, it sure seemed like about half of them didn’t get sick.</p><p>Pretty god­damn cool, if you ask me.</p><p>If you want to have study rigor performed on your body, you can look for clini­cal tri­als at <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">clini­cal­tri­als.gov</a>. 1DaySooner ad­vo­cates for hu­man challenge tri­als; they have <a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/recruiting-challenge-studies/">a list of challenge tri­als that are ac­tively re­cruit­ing</a> and you can also <a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/volunteer/">sign up for email alerts</a>.

The author highlights the rapid spread and serious consequences of dysentery, particularly its high fatality rate among vulnerable populations. They describe the purpose of human challenge trials, which involve infecting participants to study treatments more effectively than traditional trials. The author signed up for a phage-based treatment study, intrigued by the potential of bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics, especially in the context of growing antibiotic resistance. Despite concerns, the author spent their 30th birthday in a 'dysentery ward,' emphasizing the controlled environment of the trial. As shigellosis symptoms began to manifest, they experienced significant discomfort, yet were assured of safety due to medical oversight. The author eventually received effective treatment with antibiotics, highlighting the success of the trial. Reflecting on their experience, the article concludes with a note on the importance of advancing phage therapy as a critical tool in managing antibiotic resistance and the necessity of continued human trials to improve medical research outcomes."}
