<summary>
A recent study has alleviated concerns regarding the autism risk for children born during the pandemic. Specifically, it indicates that babies born during this time, including those who were exposed to COVID-19 in utero, do not have a higher likelihood of screening positive for autism compared to those born before the pandemic or those who were not exposed to the virus. This finding aims to provide reassurance to families and healthcare professionals alike.

The emotional vibe of this event invokes a sense of cautious relief and scientifically backed optimism, tempered with a lingering anxiety rooted in the experiences of the pandemic.
