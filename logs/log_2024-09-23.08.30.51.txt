<summary>
The event recounts a story about Christopher Hitchens, who initially expressed support for waterboarding but changed his mind after undergoing the experience himself. While seen by some as an embodiment of intellectual honesty, others criticize him for only empathizing with those he deemed victims once he himself experienced the pain. The article raises questions about the accuracy of claims regarding Hitchens' beliefs before and after the experience, citing insufficient sources to accurately assess his views on waterboarding and torture.
