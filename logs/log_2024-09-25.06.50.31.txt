  "input_summary": "The user expresses a prayer for the world to improve.",
  "explanation": "The sentiment of the input revolves around wishing for a better world, which indicates a spiritual or reflective nature. Given that prayer often involves intentions for peace, positivity, and communal betterment, this input best fits within the 'divine' category. The intent is not specifically about love in a relational sense, but rather a broader yearning for global enhancement, which can be considered a form of love in the context of collective well-being. However, 'love' is not the direct focus here, hence it isn't included as a category.",
