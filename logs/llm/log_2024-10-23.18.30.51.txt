So\xadciety seems to think pretty highly of ar\xadith\xadmetic. It’s one of the first things we learn as chil\xaddren. So I think it’s weird that only a tiny per\xadcentage of peo\xadple seem to know how to ac\xadtu\xadally <i>use</i> ar\xadith\xadmetic. Or maybe even un\xadder\xadstand what ar\xadith\xadmetic is for. Why?</p><p>I think the prob\xadlem is the idea that ar\xadith\xadmetic is about “calcu\xadlat\xading”. No! Arith\xadmetic is a world-mod\xadel\xading tech\xadnol\xadogy. Ar\xadguably, it’s the <i>best</i> world-mod\xadel\xading tech\xadnol\xadogy: It’s sim\xadple, it’s in\xadtu\xaditive, and it ap\xadplies to ev\xadery\xadthing. It al\xadlows you to tres\xadpass into sci\xaden\xadtific do\xadmains where you don’t be\xadlong. It even has an amaz\xading er\xadror-catch\xading mechanism built in.</p><p>One hun\xaddred years ago, maybe it was im\xadpor\xadtant to learn long di\xadvi\xadsion. But the <i>point</i> of long di\xadvi\xadsion was to en\xadable you to do world-mod\xadel\xading. Com\xadput\xaders don’t make ar\xadith\xadmetic ob\xadso\xadlete. If any\xadthing, they do the op\xadpo\xadsite. Without ar\xadith\xadmetic, you sim\xadply can’t ac\xadcess a huge frac\xadtion of the most im\xadpor\xadtant facts about the world.</p><p>The magic lives in a thing called “units”.</p><h2>Chimps</h2><p>It’s amaz\xading how much we don’t know about nu\xadtri\xadtion. For ex\xadam\xadple, would you live longer if you ate less salt? How much longer? We can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac208">guess</a>, but we don’t re\xadally know.</p><p>To re\xadally be sure, we’d need to take two groups of peo\xadple, get them to eat differ\xadent amounts of salt, and then see how long they live. This is ex\xadpen\xadsive, eth\xadi\xadcally fraught, and runs into the prob\xadlem that when you tell peo\xadple to eat differ\xadently, they usu\xadally ig\xadnore you.</p><p>So I’ve of\xadten won\xaddered: Why don’t we do these ex\xadper\xadi\xadments on <i>an\xadi\xadmals</i>? Why not get two big groups of chim\xadpanzees, and feed them differ\xadent amounts of salt? Chimps aren’t peo\xadple, but it would tell us some\xadthing, right?</p><p>Why don’t we do this? Be\xadcause ar\xadith\xadmetic.</p><p>How much would such a study cost? To figure this out, you will need three num\xadbers:</p><ol><li><p>The av\xader\xadage lifes\xadpan of a chimp.</p></li><li><p>The cost to main\xadtain one chimp in a re\xadsearch fa\xadcil\xadity for one day.</p></li><li><p>The num\xadber of chimps you’d need for a study.</p></li></ol><p>Let’s do these. First, how long do chimps live? In cap\xadtivity the av\xader\xadage seems to be around 36.3 years. (In\xadci\xadden\xadtally, fe\xadmale chimps seem to live 25% longer than males—imag\xadine hu\xadman women lived un\xadtil 90 while men died at 71.)</p><p>Se\xadcond, how much does it cost to main\xadtain a chimp? <a href="https://www.releasechimps.org/photos-and-pics/Economics%20%20Chimp%20Research_T%20%20Capaldo%20et%20al%20revised%20for%20website.pdf">Ca\xadpaldo et al.</a> looked at the av\xader\xadage costs in var\xadi\xadous re\xadsearch fa\xadcil\xadities in the US in 2009. They es\xadti\xadmate around $75/\u200bday (in 2024 dol\xadlars).</p><p>Fi\xadnally, how many chimps do you need? To calcu\xadlate this, you should do a “power calcu\xadla\xadtion”—you guess how much life ex\xadpec\xadtancy varies due to (a) salt and (b) all ran\xaddom fac\xadtors, and work back\xadwards to see how many chimps you need to sep\xada\xadrate the sig\xadnal from the noise. There are lots of <a href="https://clincalc.com/stats/samplesize.aspx">calcu\xadla\xadtors</a> for this. If you as\xadsume chimps live 36.3±8 years and salt would change life ex\xadpec\xadtancy by 2 years, these will tell you that you need 502 chimps.</p><p>So now we can do our calcu\xadla\xadtion:</p><p>  502 chimps<br />     × 36.3 years<br />     × 365.25 days /\u200b year<br />     × 75 dol\xadlars /\u200b (chimp day)<br />     ≈ 499,185,349 dollars</p><p>No\xadtice three things.</p><p>First, 500 mil\xadlion dol\xadlars is a <i>lot</i>. That’s five times what the <a href="https://dynomight.net/alcohol-trial/">big al\xadco\xadhol trial</a> would have cost. It’s a gi\xadgan\xadtic amount of money for some\xadthing that would only give in\xaddi\xadrect ev\xadi\xaddence for the im\xadpact of salt in hu\xadmans, and wouldn’t even do that un\xadtil decades in the fu\xadture.</p><p>Se\xadcond, no\xadtice how I kept the units. Always keep units! On the “top” of the calcu\xadla\xadtion, the units were “chimps × years × days × dol\xadlars”. On the “bot\xadtom”, the units were “years × chimps × days”. When you can\xadcel terms, you’re left with dol\xadlars only. Units are great be\xadcause if you made a mis\xadtake, it will prob\xada\xadbly show up in the units not work\xading out. We’ll see other benefits be\xadlow. So: ALWAYS KEEP UNITS.</p><p>(If you think you’re an ex\xadcep\xadtion and you don’t need units, then you <i>es\xadpe\xadcially</i> need to keep units.)</p><p>Fi\xadnally, no\xadtice that this calcu\xadla\xadtion didn’t just tell us how ex\xadpen\xadsive the study would be. It also points to\xadwards <i>why</i> it’s so ex\xadpen\xadsive, and what would be needed to make it cheaper.</p><p>One op\xadtion would be to try to get away with fewer chimps. The rea\xadson so many are needed is be\xadcause the likely im\xadpact of salt is pretty small com\xadpared to nat\xadu\xadral vari\xada\xadtion in life ex\xadpec\xadtancy. You might be able to re\xadduce that nat\xadu\xadral vari\xada\xadtion by, for ex\xadam\xadple, us\xading pairs of chimp twins to elimi\xadnate ge\xadnetic vari\xada\xadtion. If that re\xadduced the stan\xaddard de\xadvi\xada\xadtion from 8 years to 5 years, then you’d only need 196 chimps and the to\xadtal cost would be “only” 195 mil\xadlion dol\xadlars. Sounds nice, though I imag\xadine that cre\xadat\xading 98 chimp twins wouldn’t be free.</p><p>Another op\xadtion would be to re\xadduce the cost of main\xadtain\xading chimps. Doesn’t $75 per chimp per day seem <i>very</i> ex\xadpen\xadsive? Per\xadhaps you could find a way to use ex\xadist\xading chimps in zoos? Or you could use dogs in\xadstead of chimps and offer dog own\xaders sub\xadsi\xaddized dog chow with slightly vary\xading salt lev\xadels? Or you could built a gi\xadgan\xadtic out\xaddoor fa\xadcil\xadity with 50,000 chimps where you could amor\xadtize costs by run\xadning 100 ex\xadper\xadi\xadments in par\xadallel?</p><p>I’m not sure which (if any) of these op\xadtions would work. My point is that do\xading the ar\xadith\xadmetic quickly takes you into speci\xadfics about what would be nec\xades\xadsary to ac\xadtu\xadally move the nee\xaddle. Without do\xading the ar\xadith\xadmetic, what chance would you have to say any\xadthing mean\xadingful?</p><h2>Big blocks</h2><p>If I know my read\xaders then at some point in your life you prob\xada\xadbly con\xadsid\xadered us\xading grav\xadity to store en\xadergy. Maybe you can put so\xadlar pan\xadels on your roof, but in\xadstead of stor\xading their en\xadergy in bat\xadter\xadies, you can just lift up a gi\xadant block into the air. At night you can slowly let the block down to power your house. How big a block do you need?</p><p>Let’s as\xadsume you don’t know much physics.</p><p>To an\xadswer this ques\xadtion, you’ll need two num\xadbers:</p><ol><li><p>How much en\xadergy do you need to store to power your house?</p></li><li><p>How much en\xadergy can you store by lift\xading up a gi\xadant block?</p></li></ol><p>If you check the in\xadter\xadnet, you’ll learn that the av\xader\xadage US house\xadhold uses around 30 kWh of en\xadergy per day. Now, what’s a “kWh”? To you, per\xadson who doesn’t know much physics, it looks scary, but ap\xadpar\xadently it’s some kind of unit of en\xadergy, so let’s just write it down. As\xadsume you need to store half your daily en\xadergy for us\xadage at night, or 15 kWh.</p><p>Now, how much en\xadergy can you store by lift\xading a gi\xadant block up into the air? A lit\xadtle bit of search\xading re\xadveals that “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#Overview">po\xadten\xadtial en\xadergy</a>” is the product of mass, grav\xadity, and height: If you lift a block of weight <i>MASS</i> up to height <i>HEIGHT</i>, the stored en\xadergy is <i>U=MASS × g × HEIGHT</i> where <i>g ≈ 9.8 m/\u200bs²</i> on Earth. Your house is 6m tall, and you reckon that’s as high as you could lift a block, so you use <i>h</i> = 6m. Thus, the amount of en\xadergy you can store is</p><p>  <i>MASS × (9.8 m/\u200bs²) × 6 m</i>.</p><p>What now? Now, you’re done! You just equate the en\xadergy you need to store with the en\xadergy you can store with a block that weighs <i>MASS</i>:</p><p>  15 kWh = <i>MASS</i> × (9.8 m/\u200bs²) × 6 m.</p><p>Is this fright\xaden\xading? There are units ev\xadery\xadwhere. You never figured out what a kWh is. How is that re\xadlated to me\xadters and sec\xadonds? What does it mean to square a sec\xadond? Panic!</p><p>Re\xadlax. We have com\xadput\xaders. You can just me\xadchan\xadi\xadcally solve the above the above equa\xadtion to get <i>MASS</i> = 15 kWh /\u200b (9.8 m/\u200bs² × 6 m) and then <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=15+kWh+%2F+(+9.8+m%2Fs^2+*+6+m)"><i>liter\xadally type that into a search en\xadg\xadine</i></a> to find that <i>MASS</i> is:</p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r2LojHBs3kriafZWi/tp4qw0vhqe9ajitils7a" /></figure><p>Look at that—the an\xadswer is in kilo\xadgrams!</p><p>It hap\xadpens to be the case that 1 kWh = 3,600,000 kg m²/\u200bs². You <i>could</i> sub\xadsti\xadtute this and can\xadcel units to get the same an\xadswer. But don’t. At\xadtempt\xading that just gives you the chance to screw things up. Why com\xadpli\xadcate your life?</p><p>And as be\xadfore, the units give you a sort of “type check\xading”. If your calcu\xadla\xadtion was wrong, you’d have to be very un\xadlucky to get an an\xadswer that was in kg any\xadway.</p><p>Here the units did most of the work for you. So it’s a good thing you kept units.</p><p><strong>ALWAYS KEEP UNITS</strong>.</p><h2>More big blocks</h2><p>So, a 918 thou\xadsand kg block. How much would that cost? It seems nat\xadu\xadral to use rock, but it’s hard to get mil\xadlion kilo\xadgram boulders de\xadliv\xadered to your house these days. So let’s use steel. Cur\xadrent steel prices are $350/\u200bton. So we want to solve</p><p>  <i>918,367 kg = MONEY × 1 ton /\u200b $350</i>.</p><p>How are tons re\xadlated to kilo\xadgrams? Say it with me: <i>Not your prob\xadlem</i>. Just solve the above equa\xadtion for <i>MONEY</i> and ask the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=918367+kg+%2F+%281+ton+%2F+%24350%29">big com\xadputer</a> to learn that <i>MONEY</i> is</p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r2LojHBs3kriafZWi/ziypldfkuiyyictborbe" /></figure><p>That’s 65× more than just buy\xading a 20 kWh home bat\xadtery. But let’s say you’re com\xadmit\xadted to the bit. How <i>big</i> would that block be? Some search\xading re\xadveals that the den\xadsity of steel is around 7.85 g/\u200bcm³. So if you have a cu\xadbic block of vol\xadume VOLUME, then</p><p>  <i>MASS = 7.85 g /\u200b cm³ × VOLUME</i>.</p><p>Solv\xading for <i>VOLUME</i>, us\xading the pre\xadvi\xadous value for <i>MASS</i>, and not stress\xading about units, you can <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=918367+kg+%2F+(7.85+g+%2F+cm^3)+in+m^3">eas\xadily find</a> that <i>VOLUME</i> is</p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r2LojHBs3kriafZWi/mlrszpmbq1kptc1fbtov" /></figure><p>A 117 cu\xadbic me\xadter block is around 4.9 me\xadters on all sides.

I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I\'ve since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).\nIt\'s a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it\'s worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you\'re listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?\n"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR\'s Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he\'s performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.\n"A lot of us aren\'t great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.\nBut of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.\nFigure out what you\'re trying to accomplish\nLike speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?\nPlaylists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you\'re going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.\nSponsor Message\nThis is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!\nPick the songs\nOnce you\'ve got your mood in mind, now it\'s time to pick the songs. Don\'t be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you\'re going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It\'s fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they\'ll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).\nBobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you\'re not a professional DJ, he says there\'s no shame in cheating.\n"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.\nCrib from other peoples\' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it\'s all fair game.\nStructure the playlist like a flight\nGenerally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That\'s the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it\'s a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.\nFor instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye\'s "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It\'s nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He\'ll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.\nObviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.\nThis is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It\'s set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I\'m going for.\nSurprise!\nOne of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.\nOf course, "new" doesn\'t have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.\n\n\n</article>\n\nNext, you will be provided with two pieces of information:\n\n1.
