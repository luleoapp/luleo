The attack was retaliation for the deaths of Nasrallah and Nilforoushan, the Revolutionary Guards said in a statement.</div><div></div><div>The statement also cited the July killing of Hamas Leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, and Israel\'s attacks on Lebanon. Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh\'s death.</div><div>Israel on Tuesday began what it labelled as a "limited" ground incursion against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.</div><div>Iran\'s foreign ministry and the office of Israel\'s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which oversees the country\'s foreign intelligence agency Mossad, did not reply to requests for comment.</div><div></div><div>Nasrallah\'s assassination followed two weeks of precise Israeli strikes that have destroyed weapons sites, eliminated half of Hezbollah\'s leadership council and decimated its top military command.</div><div>Iran\'s fears for the safety of Khamenei and the loss of trust, within both Hezbollah and Iran\'s establishment and between them, emerged in the conversations with 10 sources for this story, who described a situation that could complicate the effective functioning of Iran\'s Axis of Resistance alliance of anti-Israel irregular armed groups.</div><div></div><div>Founded with Iran\'s backing the 1980s, Hezbollah has long been the most formidable member of the alliance.</div><div>The disarray is also making it hard for Hezbollah to choose a new leader, fearing the ongoing infiltration will put the successor at risk, four Lebanese sources said.</div><div>"Basically, Iran lost the biggest investment it had for the past decades," said Magnus Ranstorp, a Hezbollah expert at the Swedish Defense University, of the deep damage caused to Hezbollah that he said diminished Iran\'s capacity to strike at Israel\'s borders.</div><div>"It shook Iran to the core. It shows how Iran is deeply infiltrated also: they not only killed Nasrallah, they killed Nilforoushan," he said, who was a trusted military adviser to Khamenei.</div><div>Hezbollah\'s lost military capacity and leadership cadre might push Iran towards the type of attacks against Israeli embassies and personnel abroad that it engaged in more frequently before the rise of its proxy forces, Ranstorp said.</div><h2>IRAN MAKES ARRESTS</h2><div>Nasrallah\'s death has prompted Iranian authorities to thoroughly investigate possible infiltrations within Iran\'s own ranks, from the powerful Revolutionary Guards to senior security officials, a second senior Iranian official said. They are especially focused on those who travel abroad or have relatives living outside Iran, the first official said.</div><div>Tehran grew suspicious of certain members of the Guards who had been traveling to Lebanon, he said. Concerns were raised when one of these individuals began asking about Nasrallah’s whereabouts, particularly inquiring about how long he would remain in specific locations, the official added.</div><div>The individual has been arrested along with several others, the first official said, after alarm was raised in Iran\'s intelligence circles. The suspect\'s family had relocated outside Iran, the official said, without identifying the suspect or his relatives.</div><div>The second official said the assassination has spread mistrust between Tehran and Hezbollah, and within Hezbollah.</div><div>"The trust that held everything together has disappeared," the official said.</div><div>The Supreme Leader "no longer trusts anyone," said a third source who is close to Iran\'s establishment.</div><div>Alarm bells had already rung within Tehran and Hezbollah about possible Mossad infiltrations after the killing in July of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli airstrike on a secretive Beirut location while meeting an IRGC commander, two Hezbollah sources and a Lebanese security official told Reuters at the time. That killing was followed a few hours later by the assassination of Hamas leader Haniyeh in Tehran.</div><div>Unlike Haniyeh\'s death, Israel publicly claimed responsibility for the killing of Shukr, a low-profile figure who Nasrallah nonetheless described, at his funeral, as a central figure in Hezbollah\'s history who had built its most important capabilities.</div><div>Shukr was key to the development of Hezbollah\'s most advanced weaponary, including precision-guided missiles, and was in charge of the Shi\'ite groups operations against Israel over the past year, Israel\'s military has said.</div><div>Iranian fears about Israeli penetration of its upper ranks stretches back years. In 2021, former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the head of an Iranian intelligence unit that was supposed to target agents of Mossad had himself been an agent for the Israeli spy agency, telling CNN Turk that Israel obtained sensitive documents on Iran\'s nuclear programme, a reference to a 2018 raid in which Israel obtained a huge <a href="https://openrss.org/article/world/irans-top-nuclear-scientist-stayed-in-shadows-but-his-work-was-uncovered-idUSKBN2880MN/">trove of top secret documents</a> about the programme.</div><div>Also in 2021, Israel\'s outgoing spy chief Yossi Cohen gave details about the raid, telling the BBC that 20 non-Israeli Mossad agents were involved in stealing the archive from a warehouse.</div><h2>PAGER WARNING</h2><div>Khamenei\'s invitation to Nasrallah to relocate to Iran came after thousands of pagers and walkie talkies used by Hezbollah <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/hezbollah-pager-explosions-live-2024-09-17/">blew up in deadly attacks</a> on Sept 17 and 18, the first official said. The attacks have been widely attributed to Israel, although it has not officially claimed responsibility.</div><div>Nasrallah, however, was confident in his security and trusted his inner circle completely, the official said, despite Tehran\'s serious concerns about potential infiltrators within Hezbollah\'s ranks.</div><div>Khamenei tried a second time, relaying another message through Nilforoushan to Nasrallah last week, imploring him to leave Lebanon and relocate to Iran as a safer location. But Nasrallah insisted on staying in Lebanon, the official said.</div><div>Several high-level meetings were held in Tehran following the pager blasts to discuss Hezbollah and Nasrallah\'s safety, the official said, but declined to say who attended those meetings.</div><div>Simultaneously, in Lebanon, Hezbollah began conducting a major investigation to purge Israeli spies among them, questioning hundreds of members after the pager detonations, three sources in Lebanon told Reuters.</div><div>Sheikh Nabil Kaouk, a senior Hezbollah official, was leading the investigation, a Hezbollah source said. The probe was progressing rapidly, the source said, before an Israeli raid killed him a day after Nasrallah\'s assassination. Another raid earlier last week had targeted other senior Hezbollah commanders, some of who were involved in the inquiry.</div><div>Kaouk had summoned for questioning Hezbollah officials involved in logistics and others "who participated, mediated and received offers on pagers and walkie-talkies," the source said.</div><div>A "deeper and comprehensive inquiry" and purge were now needed after the killing of Nasrallah and other commanders, the source said.</div><div>Ali al-Amin, the editor-in-chief for Janoubia, a news site based that focuses on the Shi\'ite community and Hezbollah said reports indicated that Hezbollah detained hundreds of people for questioning after the pagers saga.</div><div>Hezbollah is reeling from Nasrallah\'s killing in his deep bunker in a command HQ, shocked at how successfully <a href="https://openrss.org/world/middle-east/nasrallahs-killing-reveals-depth-israels-penetration-hezbollah-2024-09-28/">Israel penetrated</a> the group, seven sources said.</div><div>Mohanad Hage Ali, deputy research director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut with a focus on Iran and Hezbollah, described the offensive as "the biggest intelligence infiltration by Israel" since Hezbollah was founded with Iran\'s backing in the 1980s.</div><div>The current Israeli escalation follows almost a year of cross-border fighting after Hezbollah began rocket attacks in support of its ally Hamas. The Palestinian group killed 1,200 people and seized 250 hostages in an attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, according to Israeli tallies.</div><div>In Gaza, Israel\'s retaliation has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry.</div><h2>LOSS OF TRUST</h2><div>The Israeli offensive and fear of more attacks on Hezbollah have also prevented the Iranian-backed group from organizing a nationwide funeral on a scale reflecting Nasrallah\'s religious and leadership status, according to four sources familiar with the debate within Hezbollah.</div><div>"No one can authorize a funeral in these circumstances,” one Hezbollah source said, lamenting the situation in which officials and religious leaders could not come forward to properly honor the late leader.</div><div>Several commanders killed last week were buried discreetly on Monday, with plans for a proper religious ceremony when the conflict ends.</div><div>Hezbollah is mulling the option of securing a religious decree to bury Nasrallah temporarily and hold an official funeral when the situation permits, the four Lebanese sources said.</div><div>Hezbollah has refrained from officially appointing a successor to Nasrallah, possibly to avoid making his replacement a target for an Israeli assassination, they said.</div><div>"Appointing a new Secretary General could be dangerous if Israel assassinates him right after," said Amin. "The group can\'t risk more chaos by appointing someone only to see them killed."</div><p> Sign up  <a href="https://openrss.org/www.reuters.com/world/undefined?location=article-paragraph">here.</a></p><div><p>Additional reporting by Ahmed Tolba, writing by Samia Nakhoul; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel</p></div><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.<span>, opens new tab</span></a></p>\n</event_details>\n\nAnalyze how this event would impact your emotional state.

Your task is to suggest 5 songs to add to a playlist based on the given mood and current playlist drawing inspiration from an article on how to make great playlists. Here\'s how to proceed:\n\nFirst, you will be provided with an articke "How to make a good playlist"\n\n<article>\nHow to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer\nDecember 8, 202012:03 AM ET\nBobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle\nThere\'s a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do\'s and don\'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I\'ve since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).\nIt\'s a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it\'s worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you\'re listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?\n"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR\'s Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he\'s performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.\n"A lot of us aren\'t great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.\nBut of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.\nFigure out what you\'re trying to accomplish\nLike speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?\nPlaylists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you\'re going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.\nSponsor Message\nThis is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!\nPick the songs\nOnce you\'ve got your mood in mind, now it\'s time to pick the songs. Don\'t be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you\'re going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It\'s fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they\'ll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).\nBobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you\'re not a professional DJ, he says there\'s no shame in cheating.\n"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.\nCrib from other peoples\' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it\'s all fair game.\nStructure the playlist like a flight\nGenerally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That\'s the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it\'s a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.\nFor instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye\'s "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It\'s nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He\'ll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.\nObviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.\nThis is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It\'s set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I\'m going for.\nSurprise!\nOne of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.\nOf course, "new" doesn\'t have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.\n\n\n</article>\n\nNext, you will be provided with two pieces of information:\n\n1. Mood: This is given as a PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) score.
