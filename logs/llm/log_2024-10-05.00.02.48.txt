Advocates for the change argue that failing to criminalise marital rape perpetuates gender inequality and undermines women\'s rights, asserting that consent is necessary in all forms of sexual activity, including within marriage. They highlight the legal and moral imperative to treat marital rape with the same seriousness as other forms of sexual violence. However, the government’s resistance is based on the belief that existing laws are sufficient to address the issue of domestic violence and that criminalising marital rape may disrupt family structures and lead to misuse by some individuals against their spouses. This stance has drawn criticism from various social and women\'s rights groups, who argue that addressing marital rape is crucial for protecting vulnerable individuals and promoting gender justice. The ongoing discourse reflects broader societal attitudes towards marriage, consent, and women\'s autonomy, emphasizing the need for continued dialogue and legislative evaluation to ensure that victims of marital rape receive appropriate legal protection and support."\n}'}]

This estimation is based on observations and calculations of the comet\'s orbit and trajectory. The comet, discovered in 2020, is currently making its way towards the Sun and is expected to be visible to Earth in the near future. Researchers are particularly interested in this comet due to its long journey and the historical insights it may provide regarding the solar system\'s evolution. Additionally, the unique composition and characteristics of the comet can help scientists understand more about the primordial materials that formed the solar system. The upcoming passage of Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS presents an opportunity for astronomers to study this celestial body in detail, potentially unveiling the mysteries of its structure and origins. Observations during its visible approach could lead to significant findings that may enrich our understanding of comets and their roles in the solar system\'s history. As the comet approaches, it will capture the attention of both amateur and professional astronomers alike, contributing to a greater appreciation of these fascinating objects in our cosmic neighborhood."\n}'}]
