These laws, perceived as measures enhancing military aggression, have sparked fear that they could exacerbate the already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where civilians face significant challenges including limited access to essential services and resources. Furthermore, international critics warn these legal changes may violate human rights and exacerbate tensions in the region, potentially undermining efforts for peace. The laws have ignited a heated debate about the balance between security and humanitarian considerations, leading to calls for more stringent oversight of military actions.

But they stopped short of saying the election was rigged.President Salome Zourabichvili, a former ally of Georgian Dream who has become its leading critic, urged people to take to the streets to protest against the results of the ballot.In an address on Sunday, Zourabichvili - whose powers are mainly ceremonial - referred to the result as a "Russian special operation". She did not clarify what she meant by the term.Zourabichvili urged Georgians to protest in the centre of the capital on Monday evening to show the world "that we do not recognise these elections".Russia angrily denied charges of election interference."We strongly reject such accusations - as you know, they have become standard for many countries. At the slightest thing, they immediately accuse Russia of interference... There was no interference and the accusations are absolutely unfounded," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.Peskov described the election result as "the choice of the Georgian people" and said it was the West, not Russia, that was trying to destabilise the situation.\'CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER\' CHALLENGEDGeorgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze accused the opposition on Monday of attempting to "shake the constitutional order" of the country, local media reported. He also said his government remained committed to European integration.But among the strongest responses in Europe to the events in Tbilisi, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Georgian opposition parties were "absolutely right" to dispute the election results, and he too pointed a finger at Moscow."We all know what Russian interference systems are," he told Italian daily Il Messaggero in an interview published on Monday.NATO added its voice on Monday to the calls for a full probe of what it called the "uneven playing field" in Georgia\'s election, echoing an earlier demand from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken."... we encourage Georgia\'s political leaders to respect the rule of law, repeal legislation that undermines fundamental freedoms, and address deficiencies in the electoral process together," Blinken said in his statement.Shares in London-listed Georgian banks fell on Monday, with TBC Bank (TBCG.L), opens new tab down 9.8% and Bank of Georgia (BGEO.L), opens new tab down 7.3%, amid concerns of possible political instability.The European Union also urged Georgia to swiftly and transparently investigate alleged irregularities in the vote."The EU recalls that any legislation that undermines the fundamental rights and freedoms of Georgian citizens and runs counter to the values and principles upon which the EU is founded, must be repealed," the European Commission said in a joint statement with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.For years, Georgia was one of the most pro-Western countries to emerge from the Soviet Union, with polls showing many Georgians disliking Russia for its support of two breakaway regions of their country.Russia defeated Georgia in their brief war over the rebel province of South Ossetia in 2008.The election result poses a challenge to the EU\'s ambition to expand by bringing in more former Soviet states.Moldova earlier this month narrowly approved adding a clause to the constitution defining EU accession as a goal. Moldovan officials said Russia meddled in the election, a claim denied by Moscow.

However, the unexpected fallout from these decisions alienated key voter segments, leading to criticism from both opposition parties and his own allies. This miscalculation weakened Ishiba\'s influence within the ruling party and diminished public trust in his leadership capabilities. The backlash has sparked concerns about the party\'s direction and its ability to govern effectively. In the wake of this defeat, Ishiba is faced with the challenge of rebuilding his party\'s image and regaining support from disillusioned constituents. The political landscape remains fraught, as opposition parties seize the opportunity to capitalize on the ruling party\'s vulnerabilities. This episode highlights the risks inherent in political maneuvering and the delicate balance leaders must maintain to stay connected with the electorate. Ultimately, Ishiba\'s gamble serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of thoughtful decision-making in governance and the potential consequences of losing sight of public sentiment."\n}'}]

Bodies were scattered on the ground, while some carried wounded children in their arms before loading them in a vehicle.The Israeli military said it was looking into the report on the strike on the school.Two local journalists were among those killed at the school in Shati - Saed Radwan, head of digital media at Hamas Al-Aqsa television and Hanin Baroud, according to Hamas media.On Sunday, Israel\'s military said it had killed more than 40 militants in the Jabalia area in the past 24 hours, as well as dismantling infrastructure and locating large quantities of military equipment.In addition, Israel said its forces had eliminated a militant cell in a clash in central Gaza.RISING DEATH TOLLMeanwhile, the death toll from an Israeli airstrike late on Saturday on a residential district in the nearby town of Beit Lahiya rose to 40, WAFA said.The Israeli military said it had carried out "a precise strike using precise munitions" on Hamas fighters in a building in Beit Lahiya, hitting a number of them.It said the high number of casualties mentioned in the WAFA report did not align with the type of munitions used in the precision attack.Israeli military strikes on the towns of Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza have so far killed around 800 people during a three-week offensive, the Gaza health ministry said.Palestinian health officials said the ongoing Israeli aerial and ground offensive has wrecked the healthcare system in northern Gaza and was blocking medical teams from reaching bombed sites.The Civil Emergency Service said two days ago that their operations were halted after Israel detained and wounded several of their personnel and bombed their only fire truck.

Israel said it struck military sites in Iran early on Saturday in retaliation for Tehran\'s attacks on Israel earlier this month, the latest step in the escalating conflict between the heavily armed rivals.Iranian media reported at least two waves of multiple explosions over more than two hours in the capital and at nearby military bases, playing down the attacks in initial reports and highlighting Iran\'s air defenses.The Middle East has been on edge awaiting Israel\'s retaliation for a ballistic-missile barrage carried out by Iran on Oct. 1, in which around 200 missiles were fired at Israel, Iran\'s second direct attack on Israel in six months.Those strikes, which Iran said targeted Israeli military facilities, came after Israel killed the top leadership of Iranian ally Hezbollah in Lebanon.Hezbollah militants joined the fight against Israel in support of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group based in Gaza, also aligned with Tehran, after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023."In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel – right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran," Israel\'s military said in a statement.Israel has the right and duty to respond to attacks from Tehran and its proxies, which have included missile strikes launched from Iranian soil, the military said.Targets did not include energy infrastructure or nuclear facilities, a U.S. official said.ABC said the attack was ongoing and expected to be a one-night affair.U.S. President Joe Biden had warned that Washington, Israel\'s main backer and supplier of arms, would not support a strike on Tehran\'s nuclear sites and has said Israel should consider alternatives to attacking Iran\'s oil fields.IRAN PLAYS DOWN STRIKESIranian state TV quoted a military spokesman as saying the explosions heard in Tehran were linked "to air defense systems reacting to efforts by the Zionist regime (Israel) to attack three locations outside the city of Tehran."Anti-aircraft fire was being heard in central Teharan, state news agency IRNA reported.The semi-official Iranian Fars news agency said several military bases in the west and southwest of Tehran had been targeted by Israel.Iranian state media reported strong explosions that began around 2am local time (2230 GMT Friday), but played down the attack in initial reports, saying life continued as normal.The Tasnim News Agency said Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps bases that were attacked were not damaged.State TV showed footage of Tehran\'s Imam Khomeini international airport with arriving passengers getting off their flights.Israel also targeted some military sites in Syria\'s central and southern parts with airstrikes early on Saturday, Syrian state news agency SANA reported.Syrian air defense forces intercepted missiles launched by Israel "from the direction of the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights and the Lebanese territories" and shot down some of them, SANA added.Israel has not confirmed striking Syria.Iraq suspected flights in all of its airports until further notice, its state news agency said.Iranian authorities have repeatedly warned Israel against launching an attack, saying any strike on Iran would be met with stronger retaliation.U.S. INFORMED AHEAD OF STRIKESIsrael said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant were closely following the operation at the military\'s command and control center in Tel Aviv.Gallant spoke to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin shortly after Israel\'s response began, a U.S. defense official said.The United States was notified by Israel ahead of its strikes on targets in Iran but was not involved in the operation, a U.S. official told Reuters.Fears that Iran and the U.S. would be drawn into a regional war have risen with Israel\'s intensifying assault on Hezbollah since last month, including airstrikes on Beirut and a ground operation, as well as its year-old conflict in the Gaza Strip.Even as it sought to convince Israel to calibrate its strikes on Iran to avoid escalation, the United States moved to reassure its closest ally in the Middle East that it would aid in its defense should Tehran decide to stage a counter-attack.This included Biden\'s decision to move the U.S. military\'s THAAD anti-missile defenses to Israel, along with about 100 U.S. soldiers to operate them.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that Israel\'s retaliation should not lead to greater escalation.

Iranian media reported multiple explosions over Tehran and nearby military bases, emphasizing the effectiveness of its air defenses while downplaying the extent of the damage. Israel justified its actions as necessary to counter ongoing Iranian aggressions and missile strikes from Iranian soil. Hezbollah, an ally of Iran, also engaged in conflict against Israel after the October 7 Hamas attack. The U.S. was informed of Israel\'s operations but clarified that it was not involved in the attacks. Concerns about a broader regional conflict have escalated amid increased military actions, including airstrikes on Hezbollah positions and a ground offensive in Gaza. The U.S., while urging Israel to exercise caution, reinforced its commitment to Israel\'s defense, including deploying THAAD anti-missile systems. Iranian officials threatened retaliation, warning that any aggression towards Iran would yield severe consequences. As regional tensions mount, diplomatic efforts are ongoing to de-escalate the situation and avoid a larger confrontation involving the U.S. and Iran."\n}'}]
