The article highlights how these activities are not only harming the environment but also exacerbating social issues, including displacement of indigenous populations and conflict over land rights. Authorities struggle to enforce regulations due to corruption, limited resources, and the remote locations of many mining sites. The economic allure of gold drives many into illegal mining, often in search of quick profits, yet the long-term consequences for both people and the planet are dire. There is an urgent need for sustainable practices and stricter enforcement of laws to protect vulnerable ecosystems and communities. Collaboration between governments, environmental organizations, and local populations is essential to address the challenges posed by illegal gold mining and to promote responsible stewardship of natural resources."\n}'}]

This perspective promotes a linear view of progress and problem-solving, often sidelining individual experiences and emotional responses in favor of systemic calculations. In contrast, the second analogy compares society to a living organism, highlighting interconnection, growth, and adaptation. This view acknowledges the importance of empathy and human relationships, suggesting that social progress emerges from collective consciousness and cooperation rather than mere efficiency. The article argues that the machine analogy can create a sense of detachment and disillusionment, while the organism analogy fosters a deeper understanding of community and shared struggles. Ultimately, the author calls for a balance between these analogies, advocating for a more nuanced approach that recognizes both the functional and emotional aspects of human society. By embracing elements from both perspectives, this balanced view can unite individuals, promoting a more compassionate and resilient community, essential for addressing contemporary social challenges."\n}'}]

In\xadstead, I think we need to go back to ba\xadsics and re\xadject #1. Speci\xadfi\xadcally, I have two ob\xadjec\xadtions to the idea that ideal\xadized rea\xadson\xading should be un\xadder\xadstood in terms of propo\xadsi\xadtions that are true or false:</p><ol><li><p>We should as\xadsign truth-val\xadues that are in\xadter\xadme\xaddi\xadate be\xadtween true and false (<strong>fuzzy truth-val\xadues</strong>)</p></li><li><p>We should rea\xadson in terms of <i>mod\xadels</i> rather than propo\xadsi\xadtions (the <strong>se\xadman\xadtic view</strong>)</p></li></ol><p>I’ll defend each claim in turn.</p><h3><strong>De\xadgrees of truth</strong></h3><p>For\xadmal lan\xadguages (like code) are only able to ex\xadpress ideas that can be pinned down pre\xadcisely. Nat\xadu\xadral lan\xadguages, by con\xadtrast, can re\xadfer to vague con\xadcepts which don’t have clear, fixed bound\xadaries. For ex\xadam\xadple, the truth-val\xadues of propo\xadsi\xadtions which con\xadtain <a href="https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/grammar/b1-b2-grammar/adjectives-gradable-non-gradable">grad\xadable ad\xadjec\xadtives</a> like “large” or “quiet” or “happy” de\xadpend on how we in\xadter\xadpret those ad\xadjec\xadtives. In\xadtu\xaditively speak\xading, a de\xadscrip\xadtion of some\xadthing as “large” can be more or less true de\xadpend\xading on how large it ac\xadtu\xadally is. The most com\xadmon way to for\xadmu\xadlate this spec\xadtrum is as “fuzzy” truth-val\xadues which range from 0 to 1. A value close to 1 would be as\xadsigned to claims that are clearly true, and a value close to 0 would be as\xadsigned to claims that are clearly false, with claims that are “kinda true” in the mid\xaddle.</p><p>Another type of “kinda true” state\xadments are ap\xadprox\xadi\xadma\xadtions. For ex\xadam\xadple, if I claim that there’s a gro\xadcery store 500 me\xadters away from my house, that’s prob\xada\xadbly true in an <i>ap\xadprox\xadi\xadmate</i> sense, but false in a <i>pre\xadcise</i> sense. But once we start dis\xadt\xadin\xadguish\xading the differ\xadent senses that a con\xadcept can have, it be\xadcomes clear that ba\xadsi\xadcally <i>any</i> con\xadcept can have widely di\xadver\xadgent cat\xade\xadgory bound\xadaries de\xadpend\xading on the con\xadtext. <a href="https://metarationality.com/refrigerator">A strik\xading ex\xadam\xadple from Chap\xadman</a>: </p><blockquote><p>A: Is there any wa\xadter in the re\xadfriger\xada\xadtor?<br />B: Yes.<br />A: Where? I don’t see it.<br />B: In the cells of the egg\xadplant.</p></blockquote><p>The claim that there’s wa\xadter in the re\xadfriger\xada\xadtor is tech\xadni\xadcally true, but prag\xadmat\xadi\xadcally false. And the con\xadcept of “wa\xadter” is far bet\xadter-defined than al\xadmost all ab\xadstract con\xadcepts (like the ones I’m us\xading in this post). So we should treat nat\xadu\xadral-lan\xadguage propo\xadsi\xadtions as con\xadtext-de\xadpen\xaddent by de\xadfault. But that’s still con\xadsis\xadtent with some state\xadments be\xading <i>more</i> con\xadtext-de\xadpen\xaddent than oth\xaders (e.g. the claim that there’s air in my re\xadfriger\xada\xadtor would be true un\xadder al\xadmost any in\xadter\xadpre\xadta\xadtion). So an\xadother way we can think about fuzzy truth-val\xadues is as a range from “this state\xadment is false in al\xadmost any sense” through “this state\xadment is true in some senses and false in some senses” to “this state\xadment is true in al\xadmost any sense”.</p><p>Note, how\xadever, that there’s an asym\xadme\xadtry be\xadtween “this state\xadment is true in al\xadmost any sense” and “this state\xadment is false in al\xadmost any sense”, be\xadcause the lat\xadter can ap\xadply to two differ\xadent types of claims. Firstly, claims that are mean\xadingful but false (“there’s a tiger in my house”). Se\xadcondly, claims that are <i>non\xadsense</i>—there are just no mean\xadingful in\xadter\xadpre\xadta\xadtions of them at all (“col\xador\xadless green ideas sleep fu\xadri\xadously”). We can of\xadten dis\xadt\xadin\xadguish these two types of claims by negat\xading them: “there isn’t a tiger in my house” is true, whereas “col\xador\xadless green ideas don’t sleep fu\xadri\xadously” is still non\xadsense. Of course, non\xadsense is also a mat\xadter of de\xadgree—e.g. metaphors are by de\xadfault less mean\xadingful than con\xadcrete claims, but still not en\xadtirely non\xadsense.</p><p>So I’ve mo\xadti\xadvated fuzzy truth-val\xadues from four differ\xadent an\xadgles: vague\xadness, ap\xadprox\xadi\xadma\xadtion, con\xadtext-de\xadpen\xaddence, and sense vs non\xadsense. The key idea be\xadhind each of them is that con\xadcepts have fluid and amor\xadphous cat\xade\xadgory bound\xadaries (a prop\xaderty called <a href="https://metarationality.com/nebulosity"><i>neb\xadu\xadlos\xadity</i></a>). How\xadever, putting all of these differ\xadent as\xadpects of neb\xadu\xadlos\xadity on the same zero-to-one scale might be an over\xadsim\xadplifi\xadca\xadtion. More gen\xader\xadally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">fuzzy logic</a> has few of the ap\xadpeal\xading prop\xader\xadties of clas\xadsi\xadcal logic, and (to my knowl\xadedge) isn’t very di\xadrectly use\xadful. So I’m not claiming that we should adopt fuzzy logic whole\xadsale, or that we know what it means for a given propo\xadsi\xadtion to be X% true in\xadstead of Y% true (a ques\xadtion which I’ll come back to in a fol\xadlow-up post). For now, I’m just claiming that there’s an im\xadpor\xadtant sense in which think\xading in terms of fuzzy truth-val\xadues is <i>less wrong</i> (an\xadother non-bi\xadnary truth-value) than only think\xading in terms of bi\xadnary truth-val\xadues.</p><h3><strong>Model-based reasoning</strong></h3><p>The in\xadtu\xaditions in fa\xadvor of fuzzy truth-val\xadues be\xadcome clearer when we ap\xadply them, not just to in\xaddi\xadvi\xadd\xadual propo\xadsi\xadtions, but to <i>mod\xadels</i> of the world. By a model I mean a (math\xade\xadmat\xadi\xadcal) struc\xadture that at\xadtempts to de\xadscribe some as\xadpect of re\xadal\xadity. For ex\xadam\xadple, a model of the weather might have vari\xadables rep\xadre\xadsent\xading tem\xadper\xada\xadture, pres\xadsure, and hu\xadmidity at differ\xadent lo\xadca\xadtions, and a pro\xadce\xaddure for up\xaddat\xading them over time. A model of a chem\xadi\xadcal re\xadac\xadtion might have vari\xadables rep\xadre\xadsent\xading the start\xading con\xadcen\xadtra\xadtions of differ\xadent re\xadac\xadtants, and a method for de\xadter\xadmin\xading the equil\xadibrium con\xadcen\xadtra\xadtions. Or, more sim\xadply, a model of the Earth might just be a sphere.</p><p>In or\xadder to pin down the differ\xadence be\xadtween rea\xadson\xading about propo\xadsi\xadtions and rea\xadson\xading about mod\xadels, philoso\xadphers of sci\xadence have drawn on con\xadcepts from math\xade\xadmat\xadi\xadcal logic. They dis\xadt\xadin\xadguish be\xadtween the <i>syn\xadtac\xadtic</i> con\xadtent of a the\xadory (the ax\xadioms of the the\xadory) and its <i>se\xadman\xadtic</i> con\xadtent (the mod\xadels for which those ax\xadioms hold). <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structure-scientific-theories/">As an ex\xadam\xadple</a>, con\xadsider the three ax\xadioms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane">pro\xadjec\xadtive planes</a>:</p><ol><li><p>For any two points, ex\xadactly one line lies on both.</p></li><li><p>For any two lines, ex\xadactly one point lies on both.</p></li><li><p>There ex\xadists a set of four points such that no line has more than two of them.</p></li></ol><p>There are in\xadfinitely many mod\xadels for which these ax\xadioms hold; here’s one of the sim\xadplest:</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="Geometric figure including triangle ACE with interior circle BDF and center point G.

I think so, for two rea\xadsons. Firstly, most mod\xadels are very difficult to put into propo\xadsi\xadtional form. We each have im\xadplicit men\xadtal mod\xadels of our friends’ per\xadson\xadal\xadities, of how liquids flow, of what a given ob\xadject feels like, etc, which are far richer than we can ex\xadpress propo\xadsi\xadtion\xadally. The same is true even for many for\xadmal mod\xadels—speci\xadfi\xadcally those whose in\xadter\xadnal struc\xadture doesn’t di\xadrectly cor\xadre\xadspond to the struc\xadture of the world. For ex\xadam\xadple, a neu\xadral net\xadwork might en\xadcode a great deal of real-world knowl\xadedge, but even full ac\xadcess to the weights doesn’t al\xadlow us to ex\xadtract that knowl\xadedge di\xadrectly—the fact that a given weight is 0.3 doesn’t al\xadlow us to claim that any real-world en\xadtity has the value 0.3.</p><p>What about sci\xaden\xadtific mod\xadels where each el\xade\xadment of the model <i>is</i> in\xadtended to cor\xadre\xadspond to an as\xadpect of re\xadal\xadity? For ex\xadam\xadple, what’s the differ\xadence be\xadtween mod\xadel\xading the Earth as a sphere, and just be\xadliev\xading the propo\xadsi\xadtion “the Earth is a sphere”? My an\xadswer: think\xading in terms of propo\xadsi\xadtions (known in philos\xado\xadphy of sci\xadence as the <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/Suppe_2000.pdf"><i>syn\xadtac\xadtic view</i></a>) bi\xadases us to\xadwards as\xadsign\xading truth val\xadues in a <i>re\xadduc\xadtion\xadist</i> way. This works when you’re us\xading bi\xadnary truth-val\xadues, be\xadcause they re\xadlate to each other ac\xadcord\xading to clas\xadsi\xadcal logic. But when you’re us\xading fuzzy truth-val\xadues, the re\xadla\xadtion\xadships be\xadtween the truth-val\xadues of differ\xadent propo\xadsi\xadtions be\xadcome much more com\xadpli\xadcated. And so think\xading in terms of mod\xadels (known as the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/187834"><i>se\xadman\xadtic view</i></a>) is bet\xadter be\xadcause mod\xadels can be as\xadsigned truth-val\xadues in a <i>holis\xadtic </i>way.</p><p>As an ex\xadam\xadple: “the Earth is a sphere” is mostly true, and “ev\xadery point on the sur\xadface of a sphere is equally far away from its cen\xadter” is pre\xadcisely true. But “ev\xadery point on the sur\xadface of the Earth is equally far away from the Earth’s cen\xadter” seems ridicu\xadlous—e.g. it im\xadplies that moun\xadtains don’t ex\xadist. The prob\xadlem here is that rephras\xading a propo\xadsi\xadtion in log\xadi\xadcally equiv\xada\xadlent terms can dra\xadmat\xadi\xadcally af\xadfect its im\xadplicit con\xadtext, and there\xadfore the de\xadgree of truth we as\xadsign to it in iso\xadla\xadtion.</p><p>The se\xadman\xadtic view solves this by sep\xada\xadrat\xading claims about the struc\xadture of the model it\xadself from claims about how the model re\xadlates to the world. The former are typ\xadi\xadcally much less neb\xadu\xadlous—claims like “in the spher\xadi\xadcal model of the Earth, ev\xadery point on the Earth’s sur\xadface is equally far away from the cen\xadter” are straight\xadfor\xadwardly true. But we can then bring in neb\xadu\xadlos\xadity when talk\xading about the model as a whole—e.g. “my spher\xadi\xadcal model of the Earth is closer to the truth than your flat model of the Earth”, or “my spher\xadi\xadcal model of the Earth is use\xadful for do\xading as\xadtro\xadnom\xadi\xadcal calcu\xadla\xadtions and ter\xadrible for figur\xading out where to go skiing”. (Note that we can make similar claims about the men\xadtal mod\xadels, neu\xadral net\xadworks, etc, dis\xadcussed above.)</p><p>We might then won\xadder: should we be talk\xading about the truth of en\xadtire mod\xadels at all? Or can we just talk about their use\xadful\xadness in differ\xadent con\xadtexts, with\xadout the con\xadcept of truth? This is <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/"><i>the</i> ma\xadjor de\xadbate in philos\xado\xadphy of sci\xadence</a>. I per\xadson\xadally think that in or\xadder to ex\xadplain why sci\xaden\xadtific the\xado\xadries can of\xadten pre\xaddict a wide range of differ\xadent phe\xadnom\xadena, we need to make claims about how well they de\xadscribe the struc\xadture of re\xadal\xadity—i.e. how true they are. But we should still use de\xadgrees of truth when do\xading so, be\xadcause even our most pow\xader\xadful sci\xaden\xadtific mod\xadels aren’t fully true. We know that gen\xaderal rel\xada\xadtivity isn’t fully true, for ex\xadam\xadple, be\xadcause it con\xadflicts with quan\xadtum me\xadchan\xadics. Even so, it would be ab\xadsurd to call gen\xaderal rel\xada\xadtivity false, be\xadcause it clearly de\xadscribes a ma\xadjor part of the struc\xadture of phys\xadi\xadcal re\xadal\xadity. Mean\xadwhile New\xadto\xadnian me\xadchan\xadics is fur\xadther away from the truth than gen\xaderal rel\xada\xadtivity, but still much closer to the truth than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_physics">Aris\xadtotelian me\xadchan\xadics</a>, which in turn is much closer to the truth than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism">an\xadi\xadmism</a>. The gen\xaderal point I’m try\xading to illus\xadtrate here was <a href="https://hermiene.net/essays-trans/relativity_of_wrong.html">ex\xadpressed pithily by Asi\xadmov</a>: “Think\xading that the Earth is flat is wrong. Think\xading that the Earth is a sphere is wrong. But if you think that they’re equally wrong, you’re wronger than both of them put to\xadgether.”</p><h3><strong>The cor\xadrect role of Bayesianism</strong></h3><p>The po\xadsi\xadtion I’ve de\xadscribed above over\xadlaps sig\xadnifi\xadcantly with the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structural-realism/"><i>struc\xadtural re\xadal\xadist</i></a> po\xadsi\xadtion in philos\xado\xadphy of sci\xadence. How\xadever, struc\xadtural re\xadal\xadism is usu\xadally viewed as a stance on how to in\xadter\xadpret sci\xaden\xadtific the\xado\xadries, rather than how to rea\xadson more gen\xader\xadally. So the philo\xadsoph\xadi\xadcal po\xadsi\xadtion which best cap\xadtures the ideas I’ve laid out is prob\xada\xadbly <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/#ProbKnowVeri">Karl Pop\xadper’s <i>crit\xadi\xadcal ra\xadtio\xadnal\xadism</i></a>.

But his at\xadtempt <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/Entries/truthlikeness/tichy-miller.html">failed on a tech\xadni\xadcal level</a>; and no at\xadtempt since then has gained wide\xadspread ac\xadcep\xadtance. Mean\xadwhile, the field of ma\xadchine learn\xading eval\xadu\xadates mod\xadels by their loss, which can be for\xadmally defined—but the loss of a model is heav\xadily de\xadpen\xaddent on the data dis\xadtri\xadbu\xadtion on which it’s eval\xadu\xadated. Per\xadhaps the most promis\xading ap\xadproach to as\xadsign\xading fuzzy truth-val\xadues comes from <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/y5GftLezdozEHdXkL/an-intuitive-guide-to-garrabrant-induction">Garrabrant in\xadduc\xadtion</a>, where the “money” earned by in\xaddi\xadvi\xadd\xadual traders could be in\xadter\xadpreted as a met\xadric of fuzzy truth.

I do think Pop\xadper got a lot of things right. But I also get the sense that he (along with Deutsch, his most promi\xadnent ad\xadvo\xadcate) throws the baby out with the bath\xadwa\xadter.

In\xadter\xadpreted in that limited way, Bayesi\xadanism is both use\xadful (e.g. in pro\xadvid\xading a frame\xadwork for bets and pre\xaddic\xadtion mar\xadkets) and in\xadspiring: if we can for\xadmal\xadize this spe\xadcial case so well, couldn’t we also for\xadmal\xadize the gen\xaderal case? What would it look like to con\xadcretely define de\xadgrees of truth?

The author lays out five foundational claims of Bayesianism and presents alternative views such as traditional epistemology, frequentism, Garrabrant induction, and radical probabilism. The main objections proposed involve rejecting the binary nature of truth in favor of fuzzy truth-values that allow for a spectrum of truth. Additionally, the author argues for reasoning through models instead of propositions, emphasizing that models capture more nuanced aspects of reality which binary logic fails to address. The distinction between syntactic content (propositions) and semantic content (models) is vital; models can encapsulate complex relationships more accurately than simple propositions. While recognizing the merits of Bayesianism, the article suggests that it should be reserved for easier contexts where all possible hypotheses are known. The author advocates for further exploration of degrees of truth and the need to clarify nuanced reasoning that can better encapsulate empirical complexities in scientific discourse."\n}'}]
