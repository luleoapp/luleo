However, should one candidate begin to pull ahead, several factors could contribute to this shift. First, voter turnout and enthusiasm play a crucial role; strong grassroots campaigns and effective mobilization can drive more supporters to the polls. Additionally, messaging and national issues, such as the economy and healthcare, can resonate differently with voters, swaying their preferences. Candidates also need to navigate changing demographics, with younger voters having distinct priorities compared to older generations. The influence of endorsements and party loyalty could further impact voter decisions, as prominent figures align with specific candidates, potentially consolidating support. Lastly, the role of media coverage cannot be overlooked, as increased visibility may galvanize a candidate\'s image and voter appeal. If one candidate successfully capitalizes on these dynamics by fostering a strong connection with their base and addressing pressing concerns, they could gain the momentum needed to clinch the lead in this tight race. Understanding these underlying elements is essential as the competition evolves and strategies shift leading up to the election."\n}'}]

We held hands while we talked about her youth, her fam\xadily, and the joys of life as she had found it. Her mind was sharp. Her eyes were clear. But when I came back on the third day, her bed was empty—she had passed away from liver can\xadcer that night.</p><p>I went home, lay down in bed and cried.</p><p>I also con\xadcluded I wasn’t cut out to be a doc\xadtor. But then I thought, maybe I could still be a sur\xadgeon in\xadstead. There was a sec\xadond part to the pre-med track. A two week course at the morgue. Maybe that was my call\xading.</p><p>So I walked into the morgue where in\xaddi\xadvi\xadd\xadual hu\xadman body parts were sorted in IKEA-es\xadque plas\xadtic con\xadtain\xaders: three in\xadtestines here, five livers there, and oh, an en\xadtire ca\xaddaver un\xadder that tarp.</p><p>I stood in shock.</p><p>For 40 min\xadutes straight.</p><p>The cool thing of go\xading in to shock around mul\xadti\xadple doc\xadtors who have seen it all be\xadfore is that they just let you stand there undis\xadturbed. I think I didn’t close my mouth or move a mus\xadcle the en\xadtire time I stood frozen in the mid\xaddle of the morgue. I watched as one stu\xaddent stud\xadied a length of hu\xadman in\xadtestines and re\xadmarked that the end bit was tremen\xaddously squishy and flex\xadible. She then pro\xadceeded to sock pup\xadpet it in mock di\xadalogue to the stu\xaddent next to her. They both burst out laugh\xading be\xadfore re\xadturn\xading to their stud\xadies.</p><p>“Th\xadese are born sur\xadgeons,” I re\xadal\xadized “Some minds are made for cer\xadtain tasks.”</p><p>My mind on the other hand was made to be shuffled out of the morgue af\xadter an hour, handed a glass of wa\xadter, and then plopped on my bike.</p><p>Suffice to say, I didn’t be\xadcome a sur\xadgeon ei\xadther.</p><p>I tried other things though.</p><p>I tried teach\xading. It was great, but I dreaded go\xading over roughly the same ma\xadte\xadrial year af\xadter year.</p><p>I stud\xadied eco\xadnomics, philos\xado\xadphy, math, biol\xadogy, Span\xadish, an\xadthro\xadpol\xadogy, psy\xadchopathol\xadogy, neu\xadro\xadscience, and art.</p><p>I looked into ma\xadte\xadrial en\xadg\xadineer\xading, in\xaddus\xadtrial de\xadsign, 3D art, writ\xading, and char\xadity work build\xading schools in poor coun\xadtries.</p><p>But in the end I picked video games, cause I kept <i>play\xading</i> video games.</p><p>Now play\xading games and de\xadvel\xadop\xading games are two very differ\xadent ac\xadtivi\xadties—I know. So I read through the en\xadtire em\xadployee list of var\xadi\xadous game com\xadpa\xadnies and tried to imag\xadine which role would suit me. De\xadsigner? Pro\xadgram\xadmer? Artist? Sound Eng\xadineer?</p><p>I tried out each one ask\xading my\xadself which po\xadsi\xadtion would be my call\xading. I drafted de\xadsign docs, poked game en\xadg\xadines, sketched dream wor\xadlds, and dis\xadcov\xadered au\xaddi\xadtory dyslexia does not proffer a com\xadpar\xada\xadtive ad\xadvan\xadtage in sound en\xadg\xadineer\xading.</p><p>All these roles made for in\xadtimi\xaddat\xading goals. Game de\xadvel\xadoper po\xadsi\xadtions are as sought af\xadter as Hol\xadly\xadwood jobs. So I took a step back and asked my\xadself if it re\xadally mat\xadtered <i>which </i>of the roles I ended up with. I re\xadal\xadized the thing that mat\xadtered to me was “work on a cool game” while “figure out how to do that” could be a work in progress as I went along.</p><p>So I set the <i>di\xadrec\xadtion</i> of get\xadting any job in the video game in\xaddus\xadtry con\xadtribut\xading to the de\xadvel\xadop\xadment of a AAA video game ti\xadtle. This was my 10 year pro\xadject.</p><p>And 10 years later I got hired as a Data Scien\xadtist at Square Enix, where I an\xada\xadlyzed data from Tomb Raider, Just Cause, Deus Ex, Life is Strange, and Hit\xadman. My re\xadports went to pro\xadduc\xaders and de\xadsign\xaders, who then in\xadte\xadgrated the in\xadfor\xadma\xadtion in their de\xadci\xadsion pro\xadcess on how to de\xadvelop these fran\xadchises fur\xadther.</p><p>I didn’t know that job ex\xadisted when I started out. I didn’t know I’d be par\xadtic\xadu\xadlarly suited for it ei\xadther. And yet I made it. Us\xading this <s>one sim\xadple trick</s> en\xadtirely con\xadvoluted set of heuris\xadtics that hap\xadpen to work for my brain.</p><h1>Do what you love but always tie it back</h1><p>When I came up with all this stuff, I was very tired of fight\xading my brain. I was in col\xadlege, ab\xadsolutely amaz\xading at forc\xading my\xadself to do stuff I hated, and ex\xadactly the level of tor\xadtured you’d ex\xadpect to see as a re\xadsult. Then I de\xadcided life just sucked too much that way, and I’d rather do stuff I want to be do\xading and risk it be\xading dumb than live out my life like that.</p><p>Hon\xadestly, I was a lit\xadtle bit grander about the whole thing. I re\xadal\xadized I wanted to figure out how a Shoshan\xadnah-shaped brain can end up do\xading uniquely Shoshan\xadnah-shaped stuff, and ba\xadsi\xadcally ex\xadplore the part of re\xadal\xadity and pos\xadsi\xadbil\xadity space that can only be ex\xadplored by some\xadone with my ex\xadact brain and cir\xadcum\xadstances.</p><p>This logic can ap\xadply to ev\xadery\xadone. You are the only per\xadson who ever lived and will ever live who can ex\xadplore what it’s like to do stuff ex\xadactly <i>your</i> way, with <i>your</i> brain, and get the ex\xadact re\xadsults <i>you</i> will get.</p><p>So I stared at my brain and no\xadticed I had a bunch of <i>nat\xadu\xadral</i> mo\xadti\xadva\xadtions. Things I wanted to do to farm re\xadward sig\xadnals for my\xadself—the mo\xadti\xadva\xadtional equiv\xada\xadlents of a per\xadpetuum mo\xadbile. What could I do with these?</p><p>Ex\xadploit them!</p><p class="imgonly"><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6640d3e-00d1-47cb-a02e-ce4c6efd30e8_1428x836.png"><div class="imgonly"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uwmFSaDMprsFkpWet/nh9hocidkhbwlnsnqigg" /></div></a></p><p>So imag\xadine the red arc is your di\xadrec\xadtion and the green ball is you.

Hon\xadestly, I love to play around as well, es\xadpe\xadcially in video games. But that was my di\xadrec\xadtion already so that didn’t count as a <s>dis\xadtrac\xadtion</s> com\xadpet\xading in\xadter\xadest I was look\xading to wran\xadgle into my grand life plan.</p><p>So how does the ac\xadtual wran\xadgling work?</p><p>Sim\xadple—for ev\xadery ac\xadtivity you nat\xadu\xadrally want to do, try to figure out a way to ap\xadply it to your di\xadrec\xadtion. Your di\xadrec\xadtion is sort of like a <i>theme</i>—if your di\xadrec\xadtion is X and your in\xadter\xadest is Y, then go do X-fla\xadvored Y-things.</p><p>I <i>sus\xadpect</i> this works for brains that are not mine. But ei\xadther way, here are ex\xadam\xadples of how I did it:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Draw\xading</strong>: Buy game art books, study con\xadcept art and 3D mod\xadel\xading, watch mak\xading-of videos of video game artists, learn the ba\xadsics of color the\xadory and com\xadpo\xadsi\xadtion, ex\xadplore vi\xadsu\xadally artis\xadtic games.</p></li><li><p><strong>Work\xading Out</strong>: Gamefy all my work\xadouts, cre\xadate my own re\xadwards and coun\xadters, cre\xadate phys\xadi\xadcal games for my friends, play video games with work\xadout el\xade\xadments, and imag\xadine how to de\xadsign games that truly cap\xadture the joy of var\xadi\xadous work\xadouts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Logic</strong>: Learn pro\xadgram\xadming, poke around in game en\xadg\xadines, cre\xadate di\xada\xadgrams of game de\xadsign el\xade\xadments, play games that are logic-heavy, study game the\xadory (not the same thing, but re\xadally much more rele\xadvant than peo\xadple make it out to be!)</p></li><li><p><strong>Writ\xading</strong>: Write a blog about the psy\xadchol\xadogy of video games (that’s the one that got picked up by the MIT Me\xaddia Lab), chat a lot with peo\xadple about games, write scripts for my youtube videos about games, put game re\xadviews on red\xaddit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Learn\xading New Fields</strong>: For each new topic I stud\xadied I would re\xadflect on how it can be re\xadlated to video games. E.g., af\xadter a class on eco\xadnomics, I checked out the me\xadchan\xadics of Eve On\xadline, when study\xading philos\xado\xadphy I looked into con\xadcep\xadtual rep\xadre\xadsen\xadta\xadtion in video games, when ex\xadplor\xading biol\xadogy or chem\xadistry I’d try to think about how the same top\xadics could be taught or simu\xadlated with games.</p></li><li><p><strong>Read\xading</strong>: Trans\xadform much of my me\xaddia and liter\xada\xadture diet into game-rele\xadvant ma\xadte\xadrial like Dun\xadgeons and Dragons books, isekai sto\xadries, video game blogs, books on video game de\xadsign, and some of the fic\xadtion that many de\xadsign\xaders used as source ma\xadte\xadrial.</p></li><li><p><strong>So\xadcial\xadiz\xading/\u200bOr\xadga\xadniz\xading</strong>: Fo\xadcus on ex\xadpand\xading my so\xadcial play by join\xading and then cre\xadat\xading a clan, start\xading my own youtube chan\xadnel, and later set\xadting up a gam\xading data col\xadlec\xadtion cam\xadpaign (which un\xadex\xadpect\xadedly turned in to my PhD).</p></li></ul><p>Was that enough to fulfill my 10-year plan of con\xadtribut\xading to AAA video games?</p><p>Not en\xadtirely.</p><p>I still got stuck some\xadtimes. When I couldn’t come up with a pro\xadject, or I re\xadally needed to find a job but noth\xading seemed rele\xadvant, or I was un\xadhappy with the thing I was do\xading but didn’t know what to do in\xadstead. I’d look for ad\xadvice, or try to rea\xadson through my prob\xadlems. But some\xadtimes that didn’t work ei\xadther.</p><h1>When all else fails, ap\xadply ran\xaddom search</h1><p>I first used ran\xaddom search as a col\xadlege stu\xaddent be\xadcause I was ac\xadtu\xadally tremen\xaddously and ob\xadstruc\xadtively <i>un\xadhappy. </i>I had tried sleep\xading more, ex\xader\xadcis\xading fre\xadquently, eat\xading healthier, med\xadi\xadtat\xading deeply, ask\xading for help, get\xadting a med\xadi\xadcal check up, spend\xading more time with friends, do\xading vol\xadun\xadteer work, soak\xading up more sun\xadlight, and ev\xadery other self-help, self-care, and self-im\xadprove\xadment tech\xadnique on the face of the earth.</p><p>And I still felt ter\xadrible.</p><p>So ei\xadther there was no way to feel bet\xadter, or the way to feel bet\xadter lay in the space of ac\xadtions I had never tried be\xadfore.</p><p>And thus, I set out to try one new thing ev\xadery day, for 30 days. The new thing could take 30 sec\xadonds, 3 min\xadutes, or 3 hours. It didn’t mat\xadter. All that mat\xadtered was that it was some\xadthing I hadn’t tried be\xadfore. I would de\xadcide on the day what it would be—Some\xadtimes it was a whim. Some\xadtimes it was a pro\xadject. All of it was new.</p><p>Things I tried in\xadcluded …</p><ul><li><p>Eat\xading a new fruit</p></li><li><p>Ex\xadplor\xading a new part of the city</p></li><li><p>Teach\xading my\xadself cartwheels</p></li><li><p>Read\xading about a new topic</p></li><li><p>Talk\xading to a new person</p></li><li><p>Climb\xading a new tree</p></li><li><p>Draw\xading on my window</p></li><li><p>Writ\xading a new fic\xadtion story</p></li><li><p>Try\xading a new figure draw\xading method</p></li><li><p>At\xadtend\xading my first yoga class</p></li><li><p>Buy\xading bal\xadloons and ran\xaddomly hand\xading them out in the street</p></li></ul><p>Was I hap\xadpier af\xadter those 30 days?</p><p>Yeah. Sort of. Not su\xadper happy. But a bit.</p><p>Some things worked. Some things I still do to this day. I ap\xadpar\xadently like eat\xading ba\xadnanas. I like climb\xading ran\xaddom ob\xadjects. I like meet\xading new peo\xadple. Mostly I dis\xadcov\xadered that <i>nov\xadelty in it\xadself</i> ac\xadtu\xadally makes me hap\xadpier and is a nu\xadtri\xadent I can be\xadcome low on, and this can make me sad.</p><p>I think the ran\xaddom search did some\xadthing else as well though: It gave me prac\xadtice in just <i>do\xading</i> stuff, and speci\xadfi\xadcally in do\xading <i>weird</i> stuff, and then also in notic\xading what the <i>genre</i> of weird stuff is that my brain likes to do.</p><p>But how did this help me move along in my life di\xadrec\xadtion?</p><p>I think it loos\xadened me up, in\xadcreased the Over\xadton win\xaddow of what I felt was pos\xadsi\xadble, and made me feel I was free to do things in the world that I wanted—Like send\xading in my CV for a Lo\xadcal\xadiza\xadtion Tester job at Elec\xadtronic Arts the next month. They offered me the job at the end of the in\xadter\xadview… if I was will\xading to move to Spain within three weeks. Some\xadhow that didn’t seem stranger than ran\xaddomly hand\xading out bal\xadloons in the city cause I felt like it. So I said yes.</p><p>My guess is that ran\xaddom search is a way to get your brain un\xadstuck. I think it’s similar to how artists may doo\xaddle to warm up be\xadfore a ses\xadsion. Or how peo\xadple like to drink al\xadco\xadhol to dis\xadin\xadhibit them\xadselves. Ex\xadcept it ap\xadplies to all of life, and gets you look\xading at the world with a ques\xadtion mark on your brain, won\xadder\xading what tiny new thing you could do to\xadday.</p><p>Over\xadall, these were mostly sto\xadries about my life, but the sto\xadries illus\xadtrate the les\xadsons I wish I had learned a lot ear\xadlier and a lot faster. Speci\xadfi\xadcally, if you don’t know what to do with your life, con\xadsider pick\xading a di\xadrec\xadtion in\xadstead of a goal, then em\xadbrace your nat\xadu\xadral mo\xadti\xadva\xadtions, in\xaddulging them while bend\xading them to\xadward your life di\xadrec\xadtion.</p><p>And when all else fails, ap\xadply ran\xaddom search.</p>\n\n\nReturn a json with the summary in accordance with the following format:\n\n{\n  "summary": "[Your 200-word summary of the article]"\n}\n\nOnly return the JSON object as described above with no additional text or formatting outside of the JSON structure.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\n  "summary": "The author reflects on life advice, focusing on self-discovery and personal growth rather than traditional goals. Initially influenced by a humble upbringing in the Netherlands, the author faced societal pressure that limited their aspirations. Through a series of career explorations, from wanting to be a doctor to landing a data scientist role in the video game industry, the author emphasizes the importance of choosing a direction rather than a specific goal. This strategy allows for a broader range of opportunities aligned with personal interests. The author advocates for tapping into natural motivations and embracing novelty through a method called \'random search,\' where trying new activities can stimulate happiness and open doors. This approach ultimately led to unexpected career advancements, illustrating that finding fulfillment involves navigating life\'s uncertainties and actively engaging with one\'s passions.
