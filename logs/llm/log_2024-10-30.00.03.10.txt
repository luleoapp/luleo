His leadership was characterized by significant military operations and a strong ideological stance against perceived threats to Lebanon and the wider region. Safieddine, poised to take over, was seen as a continuation of Nasrallah\'s vision, but his untimely death raises questions about the future direction and stability of Hezbollah. The organization, known for its military prowess and political influence, now faces an uncertain future without its two leading figures. The power vacuum could lead to potential internal strife or shifts in strategy as different factions vie for leadership.

Russian state news agencies said it was not clear who Choe, making her second visit in six weeks, would meet.The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin had no plans to meet her.Ukraine\'s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said after talks with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Tuesday that the North Korean moves were sending the war into a new phase."This war is becoming internationalized, extending beyond two countries," Zelenskiy said on X."We agreed to strengthen intelligence and expertise exchange, intensify contacts at all levels, especially the highest, in order to develop an action strategy and countermeasures to address this escalation," Zelenskiy said.Yoon told Zelenskiy that if North Korea receives aid from Russia and is able to glean military experience and knowledge from its involvement in the war it would pose a "great threat" to South Korea\'s security, his office said.South Korea has said it may start supplying weapons to Ukraine if North Korean troops joined Russia\'s war. Putin has not denied the presence of North Korean troops in the country.SYMBOLIC?What role the North Korean troops may play is unclear.Item 1 of 3 A woman inspects the damage to a shop after a Russian drone strike, amid Russia\'s attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine October 29, 2024.

But using their presence to scare the United States and its allies in Asia is quite simple," the diplomat said.TROOPS TRAININGThe Ukraine conflict broke out when Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022 and has since developed into a war of attrition largely fought along front lines in eastern Ukraine, with huge numbers of casualties on both sides.The Pentagon estimated 10,000 North Korean troops had been deployed to eastern Russia for training, up from an estimate of 3,000 troops last Wednesday.The military in Russia was trying to teach military terminology to the North Korean soldiers, South Korean lawmakers briefed by the country\'s spy agency said on Tuesday.Moscow was also continuing to provide technical support for North Korea\'s attempts to field a fleet of spy satellites, the lawmakers said.For months, North Korea has been providing Russia with short-range ballistic missiles, artillery shells, and other weapons, according to intelligence officials in the United States, South Korea, and Ukraine.

NATO reported that thousands of North Korean soldiers are moving toward the front lines, alarming Kyiv, which is calling for more weapons and international strategies to counter this potential involvement. U.S. officials stated that if North Korean troops engage in the conflict, they would be considered legitimate targets for Ukrainian attacks. South Korea expressed concern over possible military support from Russia to North Korea and suggested that it might supply arms to Ukraine if such involvement occurs. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy emphasized the need for enhanced intelligence-sharing and cooperative strategies with South Korea to counteract this development. Analysts noted that while North Korean troop presence might be politically significant, their military impact would likely be minimal, serving more as a political tool for Russia to assert influence over the U.S. and its allies. The Pentagon estimates that the number of North Korean troops receiving training in Russia has risen substantially, while North Korea continues to supply Russia with various weaponry, indicating strengthening ties between the two nations amidst the ongoing conflict."\n}'}]
