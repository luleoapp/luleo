There was a twist: they were aiming for the low end of the mar\xadket, and didn’t care about lots be\xading sold for more than $1000.</p><p>“Okay,” I told them. “I’ll filter out ev\xadery\xadthing with a price above $1000 be\xadfore build\xading any mod\xadels or calcu\xadlat\xading any perfor\xadmance met\xadrics!”</p><p>They ap\xadproved of this, and told me it’d take a day or so to get the data ready.

How about this: I train on all available data, but only re\xadport perfor\xadmance for the lots pre\xaddicted to be &lt;$1000?”</p><p>They, to their great credit, agreed<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref0y7zn3ikr7y"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fn0y7zn3ikr7y">[2]</a></sup></span>. They then pro\xadvided me with the dataset, alongside the pre\xaddic\xadtive model they’d had some Very Pres\xadti\xadgious Con\xadtrac\xadtors make, which they wanted me to try and im\xadprove upon. After a quick look through their doc\xadu\xadmen\xadta\xadtion, I found that the Very Pres\xadti\xadgious Con\xadtrac\xadtors had made the same mis\xadtake I had, and <i>hadn’t</i> man\xadaged to ex\xadtri\xadcate them\xadselves from it; among other things, this meant I got to see first\xadhand <i>ex\xadactly</i> how this Leak\xadage dam\xadaged model perfor\xadmance.</p><p>If you make a model pre\xaddict\xading a re\xadsponse from other fac\xadtors, but feed it a dataset ex\xadclud\xading re\xadsponses over a cer\xadtain ceiling, it’ll tend to un\xadder\xades\xadti\xadmate, es\xadpe\xadcially near the cut\xadoff point; how\xadever, if you then test it on a dataset ex\xadclud\xading the same rows, it’ll <i>look </i>like it’s over\xades\xadti\xadmat\xading, since it’s miss\xading the rows it would un\xadder\xades\xadti\xadmate.

There was no twist: they had a small\xadish but very clean dataset of things they’d won pre\xadvi\xadously, var\xadi\xadous de\xadtails about each lot which were available pre-auc\xadtion, and how much money they’d made from them. Every\xadthing was nor\xadmal and sen\xadsi\xadble.</p><p>“Okay,” I told them. “I’ll ran\xaddom-sam\xadple the data into train\xading and test\xading sets, de\xadcide hy\xadper\xadpa\xadram\xade\xadters (and all the other model choices) by do\xading cross-val\xadi\xadda\xadtion in\xadside the train\xading set, then get fi\xadnal perfor\xadmance met\xadrics by test\xading once on the test\xading set.”</p><p>They ap\xadproved of this, and told me to get started.

It was sev\xaderal months af\xadter I proved this that I figured out why, and the mechanism—sel\xadl\xaders auc\xadtion sev\xaderal very similar lots in quick suc\xadces\xadsion and then never auc\xadtion again; ran\xaddom splits put some of those ‘clone’ lots in train and some in val\xadi\xadda\xadtion/\u200btest, in\xadcen\xadtiviz\xading overfit; mean\xadwhile, chronolog\xadi\xadcal splits kept ev\xadery\xadthing in a given batch of clones on one side of the split—wasn’t any\xadthing I’d been ex\xadpect\xading.</p><p>But I didn’t need to know things would break that ex\xadact way.

I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I\'ve since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).\nIt\'s a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it\'s worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you\'re listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?\n"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR\'s Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he\'s performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.\n"A lot of us aren\'t great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.\nBut of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.\nFigure out what you\'re trying to accomplish\nLike speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?\nPlaylists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you\'re going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.\nSponsor Message\nThis is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!\nPick the songs\nOnce you\'ve got your mood in mind, now it\'s time to pick the songs. Don\'t be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you\'re going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It\'s fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they\'ll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).\nBobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you\'re not a professional DJ, he says there\'s no shame in cheating.\n"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.\nCrib from other peoples\' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it\'s all fair game.\nStructure the playlist like a flight\nGenerally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That\'s the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it\'s a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.\nFor instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye\'s "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It\'s nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He\'ll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.\nObviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.\nThis is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It\'s set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I\'m going for.\nSurprise!\nOne of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.\nOf course, "new" doesn\'t have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.\n\n\n</article>\n\nNext, you will be provided with two pieces of information:\n\n1.
