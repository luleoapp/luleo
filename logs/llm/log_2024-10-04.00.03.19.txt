By enabling Kumar to continue his studies, the ruling underscored the value of empathy within the judicial system and its capacity to effect positive change in the lives of individuals who may otherwise be hindered by minute technicalities."\n}'}]

Another case emphasized the importance of chronological data splits over random sampling to avoid misleading results, revealing that treating data as time-travel led to inaccuracies. The final example highlighted a scenario where the author initially struggled with a Tobit model and how they eventually developed a leak-proof solution. Key takeaways from these experiences include acknowledging that leakages always have costs, the varying tolerability of leakages in different contexts, and the necessity of detecting leakages even when their full impact is unclear. The article concludes with a reflection on the challenges of identifying and quantifying the damage caused by leakages, drawing parallels between data leakages and general reasoning errors."\n}'}]
