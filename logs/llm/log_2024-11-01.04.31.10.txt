I spent the days just prior to my 30th birth\xadday sick with shigel\xadlosis.</p><h1>What? Why?</h1><p>Dy\xadsen\xadtery is an acute dis\xadease in which pathogens at\xadtack the in\xadtes\xadtine. It is most of\xadten caused by the bac\xadte\xadria <i>Shigella</i>. It spreads via the fe\xadcal-oral route. It re\xadquires an as\xadton\xadish\xadingly low num\xadber of pathogens to make a per\xadson sick – so it spreads quickly, es\xadpe\xadcially in bad hy\xadgienic con\xaddi\xadtions or any\xadwhere wa\xadter can get tainted with fe\xadces.</p><p>It kills about 70,000 peo\xadple a year, 30,000 of whom are chil\xaddren un\xadder the age of 5. Al\xadmost all of these cases and deaths are among very poor peo\xadple.</p><p>The pri\xadmary mechanism by which dysen\xadtery kills peo\xadple is de\xadhy\xaddra\xadtion. The per\xadson loses fluids to di\xadar\xadrhea and for what\xadever rea\xadson (lack of knowl\xadedge, en\xadergy, wa\xadter, etc) can\xadnot re\xadgain them suffi\xadciently. Shigella bac\xadte\xadria are in\xadcreas\xadingly re\xadsis\xadtant to an\xadtibiotics. A dis\xadease eas\xadily treat\xadable by lots of fluids and an\xadtibiotics is be\xadcom\xading more lethal.</p><p>Can some\xadone do some\xadthing?</p><h2>The deal with hu\xadman challenge trials</h2><p>Clini\xadcal tri\xadals in gen\xaderal are ex\xadpen\xadsive to run but pretty com\xadmon; clini\xadcal tri\xadals <i>where you are given the dis\xadease </i>– “challenged”, AKA “hu\xadman challenge tri\xadals” – are very rare. The reg\xadu\xadlar way to in\xadves\xadti\xadgate a pos\xadsi\xadble treat\xadment is to make a study plan, then find peo\xadple who have the dis\xadease and offer to en\xadroll them in the ex\xadper\xadi\xadmen\xadtal treat\xadment. Challenge tri\xadals are less com\xadmon, but of\xadten more valuable for re\xadsearch – shigel\xadlosis is a fast-act\xading dis\xadease that is im\xadmi\xadnently treat\xadable by an\xadtibiotics and un\xadcom\xadmon in the US. It would be very difficult to test an al\xadter\xadna\xadtive shigel\xadlosis treat\xadment in the US in the con\xadven\xadtional way, but it’s a great can\xaddi\xaddate for challenge tri\xadals.</p><p>I’d signed up for email alerts on up\xadcom\xading challenge tri\xadals at the nearby Univer\xadsity of Mary\xadland, and got one about an up\xadcom\xading study. It caught my eye that it was for a phage-based treat\xadment. Bac\xadte\xadriophages are re\xadally promis\xading an\xadtibac\xadte\xadrial medicines, not to men\xadtion what I’d stud\xadied as an un\xadder\xadgrad.</p><p>Here’s the thing: you re\xadally only get good med\xadi\xadcal re\xadsearch out of hu\xadman sub\xadjects. Also, I could use $4000 and this seemed like a cool way to spend a cou\xadple weeks and help out med\xadi\xadcal re\xadsearch. So I signed up, got a check-in gen\xaderal health ap\xadpoint\xadment, and shortly af\xadter, was told I was in. I made plans to spend my 30<sup>th</sup> birth\xadday in a dysen\xadtery ward.</p><h2><strong>Dy\xadsen\xadtery: it’s a mod\xadern disease</strong></h2><p>Many of you read\xading this will know about dysen\xadtery from the 1971 simu\xadla\xadtion game The Ore\xadgon Trail (or its later ver\xadsions). The ac\xadtual Ore\xadgon Trail was a net\xadwork of trails and the cor\xadre\xadspond\xading mi\xadgra\xadtion of mostly-white pi\xado\xadneers, mov\xading on foot and on ox-drawn wagon from the east\xadern US to the west\xadern US be\xadtween 1830 and 1869. About 400,000 peo\xadple* crossed the Ore\xadgon Trail in this pe\xadriod, and a lot of them were on similar trails – a bunch of stressed and mal\xadnour\xadished peo\xadple, trav\xadel\xading in close quar\xadters with their fam\xadi\xadlies, stop\xadping and poop\xading near the same trails and creeks with no re\xadgard for wa\xadter safety – dis\xadeases spread <i>very </i>fast in these con\xaddi\xadtions. From these and other stres\xadsors, about 65,000 peo\xadple died in this 40-year pe\xadriod.</p><p>Stated an\xadother way, more peo\xadple die from dysen\xadtery <i>now, ev\xadery year </i>than <i>ever died from any cause</i> on the Ore\xadgon Trail. So let’s calm down about the Ore\xadgon Trail, okay?</p><p>*Lots of peo\xadple use this 400,000 num\xadber but I can’t figure out where it came from and if this is refer\xadring to in\xaddi\xadvi\xadd\xadu\xadals or fam\xadi\xadlies – I’ve seen sources in\xaddi\xadcate it was ei\xadther. If it was fam\xadi\xadlies, it was prob\xada\xadbly count\xading the men who were “the pi\xado\xadneers” and then be\xading like “oh and there were women and kids there also, I guess.” But maybe it was in\xaddi\xadvi\xadd\xadu\xadals? Or maybe some\xadone just made this up? Again, no idea where it came from. You gotta be care\xadful ev\xadery time any\xadone tells you a num\xadber. It’s so bad out there. The only thing worse than some\xadone tel\xadling you a num\xadber is when they don’t tell you a num\xadber.</p><h1><strong>Get\xadting ready</strong></h1><p>A week or so be\xadfore I went, I’d been pointed to <a href="https://x.com/wokeglobaltimes/status/1510768591012085768">Jake Eberts’s twit\xadter thread</a>. Jake Eberts also par\xadti\xadci\xadpated in a challenge trial for a dysen\xadtery vac\xadcine, also I think at UMD and the same Bal\xadti\xadmore fa\xadcil\xadity I was at, where he got very sick and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paigeskinner/man-twitter-dysentery-trial">went viral</a> for livetweet\xading the ex\xadpe\xadrience. He started a fundraiser for dysen\xadtery re\xadlief and got a lot of peo\xadple to sign up for clini\xadcal tri\xadals them\xadselves, and now he works for <a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/">1DaySooner</a>, pre\xadmier “hey, hu\xadman challenge tri\xadals are cool” ad\xadvo\xadcates.</p><p>I read his twit\xadter thread and sent my friends this meme:</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="(chuckles) I\'m in danger." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/inHiHHGs6YqtvyeKp/nqx5ptavn5ihobdwyovu" /></p><p>I brought <i>In\xadfinite Jest</i>, which I was part\xadway through and was a lot more through (but still not done) by the time I was discharged. (I’m writ\xading this while trav\xadel\xading, and in a fit of poor timing I fi\xadnally finished it on the plane ride in, which means I now have a gi\xadant brick of a book to carry around in my suit\xadcase.) My friend Ozy said that <i>In\xadfinite Jest</i> was a re\xadally good book for read\xading in a dysen\xadtery ward.</p><p>I thought, oh, that’s in\xadter\xadest\xading, you know, a lot of the char\xadac\xadters <i>are </i>pretty mis\xader\xadable and liv\xading in a con\xadtrol\xadling in\xadsti\xadtu\xadtion of some kind. Then I re\xadmem\xadbered this one pas\xadsage, where cir\xadcum\xadstances have forced a char\xadac\xadter into with\xaddraw\xading from heroin alone, holed up for days in a pub\xadlic bath\xadroom:</p><blockquote><p>Time be\xadgan to pass with sharp edges. Its pas\xadsage in the dark or dim-lit stall was like time be\xading car\xadried by a pro\xadces\xadsion of ants, a gleam\xading red mar\xadtial column of those mil\xadi\xadtaris\xadtic red South\xadern-U.S. ants that build hideous tall boiling hills, and each vile gleam\xading ant wanted a minus\xadcule lit\xadtle por\xadtion of Poor Tony’s flesh in com\xadpen\xadsa\xadtion as it helped bear time slowly for\xadward down the cor\xadri\xaddor of true With\xaddrawal. By the sec\xadond week in the stall time it\xadself seemed the cor\xadri\xaddor, lightless at ei\xadther end. After more time time then ceased to move to be moved or be move-through\xadable and as\xadsumed a shape above and apart, a huge, must-feathered, or\xadange-eyed wingless fowl hunched in\xadcon\xadti\xadnent atop the stall, with a kind of watch\xadful but deeply un\xadcar\xading per\xadson\xadal\xadity that didn’t seem keen on Poor Tony Krause as a per\xadson at all, or to wish him well. Not one lit\xadtle bit. It spoke to him from atop the stall, the same things, over and over. They were un\xadre\xadpeat\xadable. Noth\xading in even Poor Tony’s grim life-ex\xadpe\xadrience pre\xadpared him for the ex\xadpe\xadrience of time with a shape and an odor, squat\xadting; and the wors\xaden\xading phys\xadi\xadcal symp\xadtoms were a spree at Bon\xadwit’s com\xadpared to time’s black as\xadsurances that the symp\xadtoms were merely hints, sign\xadposts point\xading up at a larger, far more dire set of With\xaddrawal phe\xadnom\xadena that hung just over\xadhead by a string that un\xadrav\xadeled steadily with the pas\xadsage of time. It would not keep still and would not end; it changed shape and smell.</p></blockquote><p>I was forced to agree that <i>In\xadfinite Jest </i>was in\xaddeed prob\xada\xadbly a pretty good choice.</p><h1><strong>Two days un\xadtil challenge</strong></h1><p>Check\xading in, ev\xadery\xadone’s bags were checked. I got the im\xadpres\xadsion they re\xadally didn’t want some kind of bad out\xadcome where they had to call cops into a ward where ev\xadery\xadone was run\xadning around with the bloody flux, which, fair enough. They did take away my craft scis\xadsors. I didn’t end up knit\xadting so it wasn’t a big deal but like I’m pretty sure I’ve taken those on air\xadplanes be\xadfore. Okay. </p><p>We were as\xadsigned a num\xadber (I was just on this side of di\xadv\xadinity at No. 107), given a plas\xadtic wrist\xadband, and shown to our rooms. We were also given two pairs of scrubs which were to be our main clothes on the ward – less risk of ru\xadin\xading hard-to-laun\xadder clothes in the more messy phases of the study – though it did mean 15 peo\xadple hav\xading to co\xador\xaddi\xadnate laun\xaddry ev\xadery day.</p><figure><div class="imgonly"><img alt="My hospital bed with folded scrubs atop, a cup of coffee, and copy of Infinite Jest set on the adjustable bedside table." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/inHiHHGs6YqtvyeKp/kec3xlhrewimyjvcxcxb" /></div><figcaption>Where I made my stand</figcaption></figure><p>The ward was more of a retrofitted office build\xading than a hos\xadpi\xadtal. It con\xadsisted of some spaces for nurses and test\xading, about 6 bed\xadrooms of var\xadi\xadous sizes (each with their own half-bath), two sep\xada\xadrate ar\xadeas with two shower stalls each, a “kitchen” with snacks and where the meals were de\xadliv\xadered to, a closet with washer and dryer, and a rec room with couches and a TV and a pool and foos\xadball table.</p><p>There were about 16 peo\xadple on the ward, an even mix of men and women. Most of them were Bal\xadti\xadmore lo\xadcals; many of them had done other tri\xadals be\xadfore. We were fully al\xadlowed to so\xadcial\xadize – dysen\xadtery is, again, in\xadfec\xadtious through the fe\xadcal-oral route, hand san\xadi\xadtizer was sta\xadtioned all over the place but there wasn’t a huge con\xadcern that we’d in\xadfect each other or even the nurses.</p><p>Life on the ward is very chill. I was wor\xadried about be\xading bored, but I’d for\xadgot\xadten that I spend most of my wak\xading hours on the com\xadputer any\xadway, so it re\xadally wasn’t a prob\xadlem. When even my iron gaze faltered and couldn’t stare at the com\xadputer any\xadmore, I read In\xadfinite Jest.</p><p>Meals were de\xadliv\xadered once a day – one cold usu\xadally wrap- or sand\xadwich-based meal, one hot break\xadfast, one hot sup\xadper dish, la\xadbel\xadled with peo\xadple’s num\xadbers.</p><figure><div class="imgonly"><img alt="Sample lunch: a sandwich, salad, and roll in plastic packaging, plus a bottle of water." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/inHiHHGs6YqtvyeKp/peeof5iqivoo2q0uf1jb" /></div><figcaption>Sam\xadple lunch</figcaption></figure><p>They were, like, fine. The cater\xaders made a few in\xadter\xadest\xading choices – for veg\xade\xadtar\xadi\xadans such as my\xadself, ev\xadery sand\xadwich/\u200bwrap was some veg\xadgies with hum\xadmus, and now and then there’d be like break\xadfast pan\xadcakes with a curry-fla\xadvored veg\xadgie ham\xadburger patty. I would de\xadscribe the fla\xadvor when drenched with table syrup as “weird.”</p><p>Like, you can <i>tell </i>the per\xadson plan\xadning that menu was like “okay, pan\xadcakes and ba\xadcon… And wait, crap, some\xadthing with pro\xadtein for the veg\xade\xadtar\xadi\xadans.” But again, I’ve eaten worse for things I’ve ac\xadtu\xadally paid for in\xadgre\xaddi\xadents for, and I was definitely eat\xading bet\xadter in terms of va\xadri\xadety and vol\xadume than I did at home. I’m not com\xadplain\xading.</p><h1>One day be\xadfore challenge: the age of phage</h1><p>This study was sort of an over-time test – ideally the first of a few, where we’d get phages be\xadfore (un\xadless we were in the con\xadtrol group), dur\xading, and af\xadter the “challenge” (the shigella) to see if they had any effect at all – if it did, later stud\xadies could de\xadter\xadmine if you could just drink the phage af\xadter get\xadting sick, or if it would work best as a pro\xadphy\xadlac\xadtic, or etc. We drank a chalky buffer solu\xadtion to neu\xadtral\xadize stom\xadach acid and give the bac\xadte\xadriophages (and later, the bac\xadte\xadria) a bet\xadter chance at mak\xading it to the in\xadtes\xadtine.</p><p>What do the solu\xadtions taste like? Ba\xadsi\xadcally all salty fluid with slight min\xaderal nu\xadance, from the buffer. Phages are known to be pretty taste\xadless so I didn’t ex\xadpect any\xadthing else.</p><h2>Bac\xadte\xadriophage ther\xadapy: send\xading a cat af\xadter mice</h2><p>A bac\xadte\xadriophage is a virus that in\xadfects bac\xadte\xadria. They were dis\xadcov\xadered shortly af\xadter bac\xadte\xadria them\xadselves were re\xadally pinned down – micro\xadscopes were fi\xadnally pow\xader\xadful enough to make out bac\xadte\xadria, and vi\xadsion\xadar\xadies like Robert Koch and Louis Pas\xadteur were pin\xadpoint\xading that these lit\xadtle noth\xading-pin\xadpricks were in fact the source of dis\xadeases. (For more on the dis\xadcov\xadery of the micro\xadbial world, see <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/07/through-the-looking-glass">“Through the Look\xading Glass and what Zhe\xadludev Et Al. (2024) Found There”</a>, my re\xadcent piece in As\xadter\xadisk Magaz\xadine.)</p><p>In 1917, Félix d’Hérelle found an agent that kil\xadled cholera bac\xadte\xadria, which passed through a fine filter, and which could re\xadpro\xadduce – a liv\xading agent that kil\xadled bac\xadte\xadria, but that was it\xadself smaller than a bac\xadte\xadria.</p><p>d’Hérelle re\xadal\xadized right away this sub\xadstance which kil\xadled bac\xadte\xadria, and which peo\xadple had ap\xadpar\xadently been drink\xading, had po\xadten\xadtial as medicine. He bred pathogenic bac\xadte\xadria in vats and added solu\xadtions, and waited un\xadtil the cloudy brother of bac\xadte\xadria turned clear – then offered this liquid to sick pa\xadtients. Many of them, sure enough, re\xadcov\xadered. I was (un\xadless I was in the con\xadtrol group) walk\xading in his\xadtor\xadi\xadcal foot\xadsteps. Dy\xadsen\xadtery was the first hu\xadman dis\xadease ever treated with phage medicine.</p><p>Send\xading a phage af\xadter bac\xadte\xadria is like send\xading a cat af\xadter mice. Phages are small, tar\xadgeted, well-adapted hunters of spe\xadcific bac\xadte\xadria. There is no way for them to in\xadfect a hu\xadman cell like a hu\xadman virus would – they are com\xadpletely spe\xadcial\xadized. Phages are already in the body, along with their bac\xadte\xadrial hosts – so you’re not in\xadtro\xadduc\xading a rad\xadi\xadcally new agent – and the im\xadmune sys\xadtem tends to play well with them.</p><p>Phage are used widely in some parts of the world – the Repub\xadlic of Ge\xador\xadgia and Poland both sell phage over-the-counter, for use in say in\xadtesti\xadnal con\xaddi\xadtions or wounds, and have <a href="https://www.phagetherapycenter.com/">clinics for per\xadson\xadal\xadized treat\xadment</a>. In the US, phage ther\xadapy is an ex\xadtremely rare spe\xadcialty, some\xadtimes even fal\xadling un\xadder the um\xadbrella of natur\xadopa\xadthy. (A phage be\xading a nat\xadu\xadral bioac\xadtive product.)</p><p>Why would you use an\xadtibiotics in\xadstead of phages, or vice versa?</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Phages</td><td>An\xadtibiotic\xads</td></tr><tr><td>Tar\xadgeted – a phage at\xadtacks one species or one strain of bac\xadte\xadria <br />Easy to find us\xadable new ones <br />More fin\xadnicky (e.g. less sta\xadble) <br />Preda\xadtor-prey phar\xadma\xadcoki\xadnet\xadics <br /><br />Mostly spread where the bac\xadte\xadria are<br />Very few side effect\xads</td><td>Broad-spec\xadtrum<br /><br />Hard to find us\xadable new ones <br />Shelf sta\xadble <br />Reg\xadu\xadlar blood-elimi\xadna\xadtion-curve phar\xadma\xadcoki\xadnet\xadics <br />Sys\xadtemic; en\xadter the blood\xadstream <br />Some\xadtimes-se\xadri\xadous side effect\xads</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>What if the bac\xadte\xadria be\xadcome re\xadsis\xadtant to the phages too?</p><p>Well, that can hap\xadpen eas\xadily – prob\xada\xadbly even eas\xadier than with an\xadtibiotics. Cells have been duk\xading it out with viruses since the be\xadgin\xadning of life. (Did you know CRISPR-Cas9, now used for gene edit\xading, evolved in na\xadture as a way for bac\xadte\xadria to rec\xadog\xadnize and cut up phage DNA?)</p><p>But the differ\xadence is that whereas new an\xadtibiotics are very hard to find, there is a nigh-in\xadex\xadhaustible evolu\xadtion\xadary font of phages con\xadstantly pul\xadling ahead in the arms race. So in short: once a bac\xadte\xadria be\xadcomes re\xadsis\xadtant to your spe\xadcial phage, just find a new phage.</p><h2><strong>Do they work?</strong></h2><p>To my knowl\xadedge, there aren’t any re\xadally gold-stan\xaddard re\xadviews com\xadpar\xading phages head-on to an\xadtibiotics. They are fid\xaddlier than an\xadtibiotics, with a spe\xadcial\xadized body of knowl\xadedge for treat\xadment – less sta\xadble, have to be in\xadtro\xadduced to the site di\xadrectly, much more care in choos\xading an ap\xadpro\xadpri\xadate treat\xadment.</p><p>One small study found a phage treat\xadment com\xadpa\xadrably effec\xadtive to an\xadtibiotics for <i>Sal\xadmonella ty\xadphimirium </i>in 36 lab mice.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefinooo6g4sj"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fninooo6g4sj">[1]</a></sup></span> Another meta-study com\xadpared mod\xadern an\xadtibiotic stud\xadies to 17 stud\xadies from the last time hu\xadman phage re\xadsearch was in vogue in the US, the 1920s-40s, and found that phages were effec\xadtive treat\xadments – but 4 mod\xadern clini\xadcal tri\xadals sug\xadgested phages were not effec\xadtive.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnreftn2v19155f"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fntn2v19155f">[2]</a></sup></span> A more re\xadcent study of per\xadson\xadal\xadized phage ther\xadapy showed promis\xading re\xadsults in in\xadfec\xadtions con\xadsid\xadered “difficult-to-treat”.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefre5vhv0osvk"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnre5vhv0osvk">[3]</a></sup></span> They seem to work best when used <i>with </i>an\xadtibiotics.</p><p>I’m not do\xading a full lit re\xadview right now.

This tasted like bak\xading soda and salt with no par\xadtic\xadu\xadlar nu\xadance, nor would I ex\xadpect nu\xadance; the dose was some 1300 or\xadganisms – as in 1300 in\xaddi\xadvi\xadd\xadual cells of bac\xadte\xadria, count ’em. A pre\xadpos\xadter\xadously scant micro\xadbial in\xadnocu\xadlum, even for de\xadvoted par\xada\xadsites it of\xadten takes on the or\xadder of mil\xadlions of or\xadganisms to lodge an in\xadfec\xadtion – but shigella is re\xadmark\xadably tena\xadcious. It would only have taken 10-200. This was overkill – a dose that WILL make you sick, un\xadless you’re pro\xadtected. All the par\xadti\xadci\xadpants drank.</p><h2>The wait\xading game</h2><p>Shigella has a 24-72 hour in\xadcu\xadba\xadtion pe\xadriod, maybe 12-96 hours on the far ends.</p><p>Per\xadhaps ow\xading to quirks of my own psy\xadche, whose ori\xadgins I’m sure we don’t need to ex\xadplore here, I find it re\xadas\xadsur\xading to have refer\xadence ex\xadpe\xadriences to con\xadve\xadniently bench\xadmark the rest of my life by. If you go skiing, you can ask your\xadself later, “is this more or less ex\xadhil\xadarat\xading than skiing?” If you fall in love once, you can com\xadpare fu\xadture loves to that ear\xadlier ex\xadpe\xadrience.</p><p>A good stan\xaddard refer\xadence point for “shared, re\xadsigned dread” is the 72 or so hours in a clini\xadcal trial ward af\xadter ev\xadery\xadone has in\xadgested shigella bac\xadte\xadria along with maybe-a-treat\xadment.</p><p>The vibes were om\xadi\xadnous. Jovially ner\xadvous. Un\xadprece\xaddented gas\xadtroin\xadtesti\xadnal dis\xadtress may or may not have been com\xading for me, but if it is, it would be ar\xadriv\xading in (on av\xader\xadage) 48 hours.</p><p>The floor was pretty quiet. The hours ticked by.</p><p>In\xadfinite Jest is, by the way, a great book. David Foster Wal\xadlace knew how to write a god\xaddamn sen\xadtence on pur\xadpose.</p><h1><strong>Let’s learn about </strong><i><strong>Shigella </strong></i><strong>pathogenesis</strong></h1><p>While I waited, I de\xadcided to read up. Shigella bac\xadte\xadria in\xadvades the body via the di\xadges\xadtive canal, and in\xadfects the in\xadtestines – both small and large. It re\xadleases a toxin that fa\xadcil\xadi\xadtates its in\xadfec\xadtion of other parts of the in\xadtes\xadtine and its even\xadtual repli\xadca\xadtion. It’s an in\xadtra\xadcel\xadlu\xadlar pathogen – some bac\xadte\xadria, like all viruses, ac\xadtu\xadally en\xadter the host’s cell and repli\xadcate in\xadside there.</p><p>Shigella ac\xadtu\xadally prefers to in\xadvade the <i>out\xadside </i>(or should I say the in\xadside?) of in\xadtesti\xadnal cells. But the body is a locked-down sys\xadtem with its own guard force, the im\xadmune sys\xadtem, keep\xading the dirty ex\xadter\xadnal en\xadvi\xadron\xadment sep\xada\xadrate from the ster\xadile in\xadside en\xadvi\xadron\xadment. Shigella in the di\xadges\xadtive tract re\xadally wants to poke through that line of in\xadtesti\xadnal cells and get at them from the other side.</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="How does Shigella get to the outside of the intestinal cell layer?" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/inHiHHGs6YqtvyeKp/gnwf10xvxzucu4ujtujw" /></p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigella_flexneri">Wikipe\xaddia ex\xadplains:</a></p><blockquote><p>Once in\xadside of the colon, <i>S. flexneri</i> can pen\xade\xadtrate the ep\xadithe\xadlium in three ways: <br />1) The bac\xadterium can al\xadter the tight junc\xadtions be\xadtween the ep\xadithe\xadlial cells, al\xadlow\xading it to cross into the sub-mu\xadcosa. <br />2) It can pen\xade\xadtrate the highly en\xaddo\xadcytic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfold_cell">M cells</a> that are dis\xadpersed in the ep\xadithe\xadlial layer and cross into the sub-mu\xadcosa. <br />3) After reach\xading the sub-mu\xadcosa, the bac\xadte\xadria can be phago\xadcy\xadtosed by macrophages and in\xadduce apop\xadto\xadsis, cell death.

Okay, imag\xadine there’s a block\xadade of tightly parked po\xadlice cars fac\xading you and you and your bud\xaddies need to go get to their trunks so you can hide in them. Here are 3 ways to do this:</p><ol><li><p>Push the po\xadlice cars to the side so you can walk be\xadtween them</p></li><li><p>Look for the po\xadlice cars with the biggest doors, so that you can squeeze through the car and leave through their trunk (or I guess prob\xada\xadbly just stay in the trunk at that point)</p></li><li><p>Get your\xadself and your bud\xaddies ar\xadrested, then when they send backup po\xadlice vans to push through the po\xadlice to ar\xadrest all of you, run through the cracks in the block\xadade that those vans open up. Then go to the trunks of the origi\xadnal cop cars.</p></li></ol><p>And then once you’re in\xadside the car, you can open the doors be\xadtween the cop cars (they’re slid\xading doors) and then travel lat\xader\xadally be\xadtween the cop cars. I love cells.</p><hr /><p>As a fun side note, <i>Shigella –</i> in\xadclud\xading the strain I was de\xadvel\xadop\xading an in\xadti\xadmate re\xadla\xadtion\xadship with,<i> Shigella flexneri – </i>is, tax\xado\xadnom\xadi\xadcally speak\xading, a kind of <i>Escher\xadichia coli.</i> Now you may no\xadtice from the sci\xaden\xadtific nomen\xadcla\xadture that this is not how this is sup\xadposed to work.</p><p>When geno\xadtyp\xading was de\xadvel\xadoped and ap\xadplied to some fa\xadmil\xadiar standby kinds of bac\xadte\xadria that micro\xadbiol\xadogy-as-sci\xadence figured it un\xadder\xadstood pretty well, re\xadsearchers learned two sur\xadpris\xading new things:</p><ul><li><p><i>E. coli</i> is not a co\xadher\xadent species. Differ\xadent strains of <i>E. coli</i> – known to have slightly differ\xadent prop\xader\xadties, but thought to be all slight vari\xada\xadtions on the same ba\xadsic species – turned out to have only <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2974192/">20% of their genes</a> in com\xadmon. (Hu\xadmans and our clos\xadest rel\xada\xadtives, chim\xadpanzees, have al\xadmost all of our genes in com\xadmon* and still aren’t con\xadsid\xadered as the same <i>genus</i>.)</p></li><li><p><i>Shigella </i>is in that um\xadbrella of shared genes – a se\xadcret fam\xadily mem\xadber known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon_in_disguise">taxon in dis\xadguise</a>. It’s more similar to many <i>E. co\xadlis </i>than some <i>E. co\xadli</i>s.</p></li></ul><p>For most species, the pro\xadce\xaddure at this point would be to throw in the towel and re\xadclas\xadsify – <i>Escher\xadichia coli spp. shigella</i>, per\xadhaps. But in this case, shi\xadga\xadtoxin-pro\xadduc\xading <i>Shigella </i>and other pathogenic <i>Escher\xadichia coli </i>have differ\xadent enough clini\xadcal pre\xadsen\xadta\xadtions that the dis\xadtinc\xadtion is still med\xadi\xadcally valuable, so ac\xadcu\xadrate nomen\xadcla\xadture has bowed its head to prac\xadti\xadcal\xadity. Cool! (Com\xadpare and con\xadtrast with <a href="https://eukaryotewritesblog.com/2021/05/02/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-tree/">trees</a>.)</p><p>*Wait, don’t peo\xadple talk about 99% or some\xadthing? That num\xadber is ac\xadtu\xadally about <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/comparison-human-and-chimpanzee-genomes-reveals-striking-similarities-and-differences"><i>se\xadquence similar\xadity</i></a><i> </i>and not re\xadlated genes – if we have 96% se\xadquence similar\xadity, mean\xading the ex\xadact same ge\xadnetic code, prob\xada\xadbly even more of that genome is still <i>in re\xadlated genes. </i>Genes can code for clearly re\xadlated pro\xadteins/\u200bse\xadquences and still not be iden\xadti\xadcal, like they came from a com\xadmon an\xadces\xadtor and haven’t di\xadverged much but have picked up a few changes along the way. Differ\xadent<i> E. coli</i> have 80% com\xadpletely differ\xadent genes – a hu\xadman has maaaybe 50 genes that a chimp doesn’t? I didn’t try very hard to find the ac\xadtual similar met\xadric be\xadtween them. It’s what I was tel\xadling you about num\xadbers. You gotta watch out.</p><h1><strong>Let’s re\xadally learn about Shigella pathogenesis</strong></h1><p>Some 24 hours in, the first peo\xadple started go\xading down. Via word of mouth I heard the phrase “Ex\xador\xadcist-style pro\xadjec\xadtile vom\xadit\xading” used to de\xadscribe some\xadone in the next room over, a de\xadscrip\xadtion whose ac\xadcu\xadracy I for\xadtu\xadnately can\xadnot ver\xadify. Most peo\xadple were in their rooms all day any\xadhow, but the crowd in the kitchen at meal\xadtimes or show\xading up for morn\xading dos\xading got thin\xadner.</p><p>I re\xadally held out. Go\xading to bed at end of the sec\xadond night, I felt okay, but couldn’t sleep well – nerves, I thought, or the faint dis\xadtorted un\xadpleas\xadant bod\xadily noises from other parts of the ward. I maybe man\xadaged a cou\xadple hours of sleep by the wee hours.</p><p>48 hours in, I woke up for vi\xadtals and dos\xading at 6 AM and started feel\xading re\xadally faint on the short walk to the next room. I stum\xadbled over to the toi\xadlet. Off to the races!</p><p>I should be clear in this sec\xadtion that I was in as close to zero long-term dan\xadger as you can get with dysen\xadtery, which is damn close – this was in a con\xadtrol\xadled set\xadting with doc\xadtors and nurses, mon\xadi\xadtor\xading my con\xaddi\xadtion reg\xadu\xadlarly, with a known pathogen with a known cure. In this case, we weren’t ex\xadpected to lan\xadguish in in\xaddefinite mis\xadery – they wanted to see if we got sick and then how sick we got, yes, but only up to a point, at which point they would “call it” – ad\xadminister reg\xadu\xadlar an\xadtibiotics and end our ex\xadper\xadi\xadmen\xadtal treat\xadment.</p><p>All I had to do was let the time pass.</p><p>The next few hours were very bad. Sur\xadpris\xadingly, the gas\xadtroin\xadtesti\xadnal symp\xadtoms were not much of a prob\xadlem for me – I had them, but it wasn’t much worse than those of reg\xadu\xadlar food poi\xadson\xading. I didn’t throw up. I just wanted to go back to sleep.</p><p>But sleep wasn’t com\xading.</p><p>First was the plague of chills. The in\xadsti\xadtu\xadtional cot\xadton blan\xadkets did noth\xading; four of them also did noth\xading, as if there was no heat to hold in. Freez\xading, tooth-clat\xadter\xading cold.</p><p>Within an hour came the plague of joint pain. It sank in rather quickly and was all in the lower ex\xadtrem\xadities – hips, legs. Any more than one blan\xadket be\xadcame too heavy to bear hav\xading on them, so off they go, freez\xading cold but they weren’t pal\xadpably do\xading any\xadthing any\xadway. Right? I re\xadmem\xadbered read\xading peo\xadple with chronic pain re\xadport\xading that some\xadtimes lay\xading down was worse than other po\xadsi\xadtions, and sure enough sit\xadting up was – some\xadhow – mildly bet\xadter. I situ\xadated the ad\xadjustable bed\xadside table so that I could slump onto it and maybe even sleep like that, but sleep re\xadmained out of reach.</p><p>Time wasn’t shit\xadting so much as drag\xadging, by the bones, over rough pave\xadment, ev\xadery sec\xadond an\xadother six inches, grat\xading, re\xadlentless, sec\xadond af\xadter sec\xadond af\xadter sec\xadond. Time is space in which you are moved for\xadward one way or an\xadother. Pain is an ac\xadtive pro\xadcess. </p><p>Around three hours later, the doc\xadtor came in and judged that I was done – they were call\xading it – symp\xadtomat\xadi\xadcally I had reached the Clini\xadcal End\xadpoint and would be treated. I was handed tylenol and an\xadtibiotics. </p><p>I’d always thought of tylenol as sort of a sec\xadond-rate painkil\xadler, prob\xada\xadbly worth try\xading if you couldn’t find ibupro\xadfen, but damn if that tylenol didn’t work pretty quickly. As soon as I could I went to sleep for like four hours – which, as usual, if you are in a po\xadsi\xadtion of need\xading four hours of sleep, makes a lot of things bet\xadter and more man\xadage\xadable once you can swing it.</p><h1><strong>Out the other side</strong></h1><p>The an\xadtibiotics worked <i>re\xadally</i> quickly. Within hours, the fever had van\xadished and the aches had dwin\xaddled to twinges. Within a cou\xadple days, even the gas\xadtroin\xadtesti\xadnal situ\xada\xadtion was back to nor\xadmal. Other peo\xadple were harder hit, other peo\xadple were just start\xading to get sick – stay\xading van\xadished in their rooms even af\xadter I stuck my head into the kitchen and rec rooms like the first hope\xadful ground\xadhog of spring – and many had been fine the whole time.</p><p>The thing that kills peo\xadple in dysen\xadtery is de\xadhy\xaddra\xadtion and com\xadpli\xadca\xadtions thereof. So part of the re\xadcov\xadery is col\xadlect\xading and mea\xadsur\xading how many fluids were emit\xadted, and then re-ad\xadminis\xadter\xading oral re\xadhy\xaddra\xadtion fluid – a salty liquid served ice-cold – in pre\xadcise ra\xadtios to re\xadplace the bod\xadily fluids lost. A hu\xadman is a se\xadries of tubes with at\xadtached ner\xadvous sys\xadtem and for\xadtu\xadnately I was in the com\xadpany of mas\xadter plumbers. Once the di\xadar\xadrhea had stopped, I was also able to stop guz\xadzling big plas\xadtic cups of what I liked to imag\xadine tasted like arc\xadtic sea\xadwa\xadter. Progress!</p><figure><div class="imgonly"><img alt="Breakfast - french toast in a plastic container and a cup of coffee - illuminated in golden morning light, at a table with a nice view out into the city." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/inHiHHGs6YqtvyeKp/wuakw5je9yziwcjqfgat" /></div><figcaption>Great view from the rec room.</figcaption></figure><p>Peo\xadple who re\xadcov\xadered and who never got sick started hang\xading out in the rec room more, chat\xadting and play\xading pool. I spent my birth\xadday call\xading my par\xadents and talk\xading to in\xadter\xadnet friends. One streamed him\xadself play\xading a fish-themed video game in my honor. The Bal\xadti\xadmore\xadans in\xadex\xadpli\xadca\xadbly set off fire\xadworks many nights – maybe the prox\xadim\xadity to July 4<sup>th</sup>? – and this was one of them. Not road\xadside-stand-ground fire\xadworks, but big aerial fire\xadworks. A fel\xadlow sub\xadject found ice cream bars in the kitchen freezer and kindly brought me one as a pre\xadsent. Fire\xadworks aside, it was a quiet day.</p><p>Apolo\xadgies for the de\xadcep\xadtion, reader. Tech\xadni\xadcally speak\xading, the word “dysen\xadtery” usu\xadally refers to a syn\xaddrome, like “psy\xadchosis” or “high blood pres\xadsure”, which can have mul\xadti\xadple causes but which is defined by spe\xadcific symp\xadtoms. The spe\xadcific symp\xadtom of dysen\xadtery is bloody di\xadar\xadrhea. I per\xadson\xadally did not get this par\xadtic\xadu\xadlar symp\xadtom – I be\xadcame sick with <i>shigel\xadlosis </i>but, ac\xadcord\xading to a com\xadmon crite\xadria, did not get <i>dysen\xadtery</i>. I’m sorry for click\xadbait\xading you. In my defense, I would have taken it over the joint pain.</p><h1><strong>Aftermath</strong></h1><p>Twice a day af\xadter an\xadtibiotics, we gave the nurses a stool sam\xadple – these were sam\xadpled and cul\xadtured at some lab to de\xadter\xadmine if shigella was still in there. Two nega\xadtive sam\xadples in a row meant that we were free to go.</p><p>9 days af\xadter com\xading in, I was cleared for re\xadlease. I col\xadlected my scis\xadsors, and, free of dysen\xadtery, was re\xadleased onto the streets of Bal\xadti\xadmore. A year older on pa\xadper. Healthy, wrung out, ready for time to keep do\xading what it does. Hope\xadfully, mostly on kinder terms.</p><figure><div class="imgonly"><img alt="View of Baltimore out a train window." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/inHiHHGs6YqtvyeKp/iznln3tz4frsnoq9zsbe" /></div><figcaption>The train ride home.

Your task is to suggest 5 songs to add to a playlist based on the given mood and current playlist drawing inspiration from an article on how to make great playlists. Here\'s how to proceed:\n\nFirst, you will be provided with an articke "How to make a good playlist"\n\n<article>\nHow to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer\nDecember 8, 202012:03 AM ET\nBobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle\nThere\'s a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do\'s and don\'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I\'ve since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).\nIt\'s a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it\'s worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you\'re listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?\n"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR\'s Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he\'s performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.\n"A lot of us aren\'t great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.\nBut of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.\nFigure out what you\'re trying to accomplish\nLike speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?\nPlaylists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you\'re going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.\nSponsor Message\nThis is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!\nPick the songs\nOnce you\'ve got your mood in mind, now it\'s time to pick the songs. Don\'t be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you\'re going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It\'s fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they\'ll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).\nBobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you\'re not a professional DJ, he says there\'s no shame in cheating.\n"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.\nCrib from other peoples\' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it\'s all fair game.\nStructure the playlist like a flight\nGenerally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That\'s the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it\'s a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.\nFor instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye\'s "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It\'s nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He\'ll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.\nObviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.\nThis is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It\'s set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I\'m going for.\nSurprise!\nOne of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.\nOf course, "new" doesn\'t have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.\n\n\n</article>\n\nNext, you will be provided with two pieces of information:\n\n1. Mood: This is given as a PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) score. PANAS is a scale that measures the extent to which a person feels positive or negative emotions.\n\n<mood>\n{\'positive_affect\': {\'total_score\': 9, \'items\': {\'interested\': 5, \'excited\': 1, \'strong\': 0, \'enthusiastic\': 1, \'proud\': 1, \'alert\': 0, \'inspired\': 0, \'determined\': 0, \'attentive\': 1, \'active\': 0}}, \'negative_affect\': {\'total_score\': 44, \'items\': {\'distressed\': 0, \'upset\': 0, \'guilty\': 0, \'scared\': 0, \'hostile\': 0, \'irritable\': 0, \'ashamed\': 0, \'nervous\': 40, \'jittery\': 0, \'afraid\': 4}}}\n</mood>\n\n2. Current playlist: This is a list of songs currently in the playlist. It may be empty or contain up to 50 songs.\n\n<current_playlist>\nCurrent playlist:\n- Apologize by OneRepublic\n- Joanne by Lady Gaga\n- Save Your Tears by The Weeknd\n- About Damn Time by Lizzo\n- Just like Heaven by The Cure\n- Bad Day by Daniel Powter\n- Moon River by Frank Ocean\n- Girls Like Girls by Hayley Kiyoko\n- Don\'t Let Me Down (feat. Daya) - Illenium Remix by The Chainsmokers, Daya, ILLENIUM\n- Ain\'t No Man by The Avett Brothers\n\n</current_playlist>\n\nYour goal is to suggest 5 songs that would fit well with the given mood and complement the existing playlist.\n\nTo generate your recommendations, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the given mood (PANAS score) to understand the emotional state it represents.\n2. Review the current playlist (if not empty) to get a sense of the musical style and preferences.\n3.

I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I\'ve since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).\nIt\'s a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it\'s worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you\'re listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?\n"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR\'s Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he\'s performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.\n"A lot of us aren\'t great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.\nBut of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.\nFigure out what you\'re trying to accomplish\nLike speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?\nPlaylists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you\'re going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.\nSponsor Message\nThis is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!\nPick the songs\nOnce you\'ve got your mood in mind, now it\'s time to pick the songs. Don\'t be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you\'re going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It\'s fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they\'ll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).\nBobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you\'re not a professional DJ, he says there\'s no shame in cheating.\n"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.\nCrib from other peoples\' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it\'s all fair game.\nStructure the playlist like a flight\nGenerally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That\'s the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it\'s a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.\nFor instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye\'s "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It\'s nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He\'ll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.\nObviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.\nThis is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It\'s set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I\'m going for.\nSurprise!\nOne of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.\nOf course, "new" doesn\'t have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.\n\n\n</article>\n\nNext, you will be provided with two pieces of information:\n\n1.

Your task is to suggest 5 instrumental pieces to add to a playlist based on the given mood and current playlist drawing inspiration from an article on how to make great playlists. Here\'s how to proceed:\nFirst, you will be provided with an article "How to make a good playlist"\n\n<article> How to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer\nDecember 8, 202012:03 AM ET\nBobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle\nThere\'s a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do\'s and don\'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I\'ve since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).\nIt\'s a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it\'s worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you\'re listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?\n"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR\'s Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he\'s performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.\n"A lot of us aren\'t great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.\nBut of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.\nFigure out what you\'re trying to accomplish\nLike speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?\nPlaylists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you\'re going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.\nSponsor Message\nThis is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!\nPick the songs\nOnce you\'ve got your mood in mind, now it\'s time to pick the songs. Don\'t be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you\'re going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It\'s fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they\'ll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).\nBobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you\'re not a professional DJ, he says there\'s no shame in cheating.\n"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.\nCrib from other peoples\' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it\'s all fair game.\nStructure the playlist like a flight\nGenerally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That\'s the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it\'s a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.\nFor instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye\'s "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It\'s nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He\'ll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.\nObviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.\nThis is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It\'s set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I\'m going for.\nSurprise!\nOne of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.\nOf course, "new" doesn\'t have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.\n\n </article>\n\nNext, you will be provided with two pieces of information:\n\nMood: This is given as a PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) score.
