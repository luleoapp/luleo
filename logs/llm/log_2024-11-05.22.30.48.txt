About a quar\xadter of par\xadti\xadci\xadpants ranked it in their top 3 of courses at the camp and half of them had it listed as their fa\xadvorite.</p><p>I hadn’t ex\xadpected that.</p><p>I thought my life ad\xadvice was pretty idiosyn\xadcratic. I never heard of any\xadone liv\xading their life like I have. I never en\xadcoun\xadtered this method in all the self-help blogs or feel-bet\xadter books I con\xadsumed back when I needed them.</p><p>But if some peo\xadple found it helpful, then I should prob\xada\xadbly write it all down.</p><h1><strong>Why Listen to Me Though?</strong></h1><p>I think it’s gen\xader\xadally worth pri\xadori\xadtiz\xading the ad\xadvice of peo\xadple who have ac\xadtu\xadally achieved the things you care about in life. I can’t tell you if that’s me, but I can tell you a bit about my life, why I ended up de\xadvel\xadop\xading the heuris\xadtics I did, and how that worked out for me.</p><p><s>I spawned in on the server</s> I mean, I was <i>born</i> on a farm in a ru\xadral part of the Nether\xadlands. My par\xadents had more kids than money. We were Dutch poor, which is ba\xadsi\xadcally kind of fine. It means we all shared bed\xadrooms, had bor\xading food, and our car would break down… Then you’d get out and push the car. And I thought this was great cause I was the youngest of four kids, and ev\xadery\xadthing was a game. My fam\xadily doted on me, I had loads of friends, and ev\xadery\xadone I knew was healthy. Over\xadall, I’d give my child\xadhood a <span class="frac"><sup>10</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub></span> for hap\xadpiness, love and qual\xadity of life.</p><p>On the other hand, grow\xading up, no one in my fam\xadily had a de\xadgree. My en\xadtire town was blue col\xadlar jobs. And if you didn’t want to go to school, you worked at one of the nearby fac\xadto\xadries. So when I grad\xadu\xadated from high school and I wanted to ap\xadply to MIT, ev\xadery\xadone told me that wasn’t real. That was a thing peo\xadple did on TV. Nor\xadmal peo\xadple couldn’t do that. It’s like be\xadcom\xading a Hol\xadly\xadwood ac\xadtor or an as\xadtro\xadnaut.</p><p>So I didn’t ap\xadply.</p><p>In\xadstead I went to the most pres\xadti\xadgious col\xadlege in the Nether\xadlands, which was … fine?</p><p>That’s when I hit a wall. This wall con\xadsisted of many parts not rele\xadvant to this story. But one part was the ab\xadsolute hor\xadror of pick\xading any ca\xadreer to work for 40 hours a week for 40 years.</p><p>That’s what ev\xadery\xadone did where I was from.</p><p>I could read books or the in\xadter\xadnet about peo\xadple who did other things but I couldn’t imag\xadine how to be like them. And be\xadsides, all that stuff was not “real”. Man\xadual la\xadbor was real. 9-5s were real. Pick\xading a trade was real.</p><p>I wanted to throw my\xadself off a bridge.</p><p>In\xadstead, among other things, I de\xadvel\xadoped my own set of life wis\xaddoms fo\xadcused on find\xading a path when I couldn’t see any way to get where I wanted to go. There have been a lot of ups and downs since then, but in the first 10 years some wild stuff hap\xadpened ac\xadcord\xading to my small-town brain cause…</p><ul><li><p>at 21, I was se\xadlected from 600 col\xadleagues, be\xadcom\xading the sec\xadond youngest Head Tester at Elec\xadtronic Arts, man\xadag\xading teams of 4-16 testers.</p></li><li><p>at 24, I ran an ex\xadper\xadi\xadment for the Euro\xadpean Space Agency on Antarc\xadtica. Un\xadre\xadlat\xadedly, I was also offered a lu\xadcra\xadtive mon\xade\xadti\xadza\xadtion con\xadtract for my 3 month old Youtube chan\xadnel.</p></li><li><p>At 25, I was offered a PhD and got my de\xadgree in Player Model\xading in Video Games—a field I didn’t know ex\xadisted till I got the offer.</p></li><li><p>At 28, I found out an es\xadsay I had writ\xadten for fun had be\xadcome part of the cur\xadricu\xadlum at the MIT Me\xaddia Lab.</p></li><li><p>At 30, I be\xadcame se\xadnior data sci\xaden\xadtist at one of the largest video game pub\xadlish\xaders in the world (Square Enix West). Later that year I be\xadcame head of their An\xada\xadlyt\xadics team.</p></li></ul><p>I’m not say\xading I had a dream ca\xadreer or am the high\xadest performer you know. Ac\xadtu\xadally, I of\xadten don’t know what I’m do\xading and a lot of my plans fail.</p><p>Gosh, hon\xadestly. <i>Most</i> of my plans fail.</p><p>But I mostly get where I want to go and this is how I do it.</p><h1>Pick a di\xadrec\xadtion in\xadstead of a goal</h1><p>When peo\xadple think about where to go in life, they tend to pick a spe\xadcific goal: be\xadcome a doc\xadtor, make a de\xadcent amount of money, or have 2.3 kids. It’s com\xadmon for peo\xadple with\xadout spe\xadcific goals to feel like they are adrift and that it’s hard to achieve much of any\xadthing with\xadout such a guid\xading star.</p><p>Or maybe I’m pro\xadject\xading and that’s just how I felt.</p><p>I sucked at pick\xading goals. Kid me wanted to be a brick layer be\xadcause I thought it would be satis\xadfy\xading to make neat lit\xadtle pat\xadterns. Ado\xadles\xadcent me had an ex\xadis\xadten\xadtial crisis about no job in par\xadtic\xadu\xadlar sound\xading like any\xadthing I’d want to do ev\xadery day for the rest of my life.</p><p>So I de\xadvel\xadoped the idea of pick\xading a <i>di\xadrec\xadtion</i> in\xadstead of a <i>goal</i>.</p><p>What does that mean?</p><p class="imgonly"><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac94b2bb-f5b7-437f-ba8e-321afffab82d_1456x557.jpeg"><div class="imgonly"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uwmFSaDMprsFkpWet/gzb8ncbux2n0qmc2golm" /></div></a></p><p>A <i>goal</i> is a spe\xadcific out\xadcome with spe\xadcific steps at which you can fail or suc\xadceed. A <i>di\xadrec\xadtion</i> is a de\xadci\xadsion heuris\xadtic that moves you closer to a wide-range of op\xadtions that all con\xadtain in\xadcreas\xading amounts of the Thing You Ac\xadtu\xadally Want.</p><p>Want\xading to “be\xadcome a doc\xadtor” is a goal. Want\xading to “heal peo\xadple” is a di\xadrec\xadtion.</p><p>To be\xadcome a doc\xadtor, you need to go to med school, pass all your ex\xadams, se\xadcure a po\xadsi\xadtion at a hos\xadpi\xadtal or start your own prac\xadtice. Then you will have achieved the goal of “be\xadcom\xading a doc\xadtor”. To heal peo\xadple … you can do so many things. You could be a nurse or a med\xadi\xadcal tech\xadni\xadcian. You could de\xadvelop a new glu\xadcose pump for chil\xaddren with di\xada\xadbetes. You could re\xadsearch a cure for Corona, Ebola, or Pneu\xadmo\xadnia. You could raise aware\xadness for Leukemia, Dyslexia, or Es\xadto\xadnia. There are so many ways to help peo\xadple get healthier, and if none of the ex\xadist\xading ones suit you, you can liter\xadally try and in\xadvent a new way to con\xadtribute.</p><p>In essence, a di\xadrec\xadtion let’s you figure out where your ex\xadact per\xadson-shape fits into the world to gen\xader\xadate a ton of “heal peo\xadple”—the ac\xadtual thing you care about.</p><p>But how do you figure out your di\xadrec\xadtion?</p><p>Well, all I can say is how <i>I</i> did it.</p><p>My di\xadrec\xadtion ended up be\xading “con\xadtribute to the de\xadvel\xadop\xadment of AAA video games”.</p><p>Not that that was my first pick.</p><p>My first pick was “be\xadcom\xading a doc\xadtor” (which, for the record, is a goal. But this es\xadsay makes the de\xadvel\xadop\xadment of these heuris\xadtics seem more clean and chronolog\xadi\xadcal than what the ac\xadtual messy re\xadal\xadity was like).</p><p>So I signed up for this pre-med track where you get to fol\xadlow around a nurse for two weeks. It was in the gas\xadtroen\xadterol\xadogy de\xadpart\xadment of the lo\xadcal hos\xadpi\xadtal. To the sur\xadprise of ab\xadsolutely no one, I was ex\xadactly as bad around hu\xadman suffer\xading and co\xadpi\xadous amounts of in\xadter\xadnal fluids en\xadter\xading the ex\xadter\xadnal world as you’d ex\xadpect from some\xadone with high dis\xadgust sen\xadsi\xadtivity and an over\xadac\xadtive sense of emo\xadtional em\xadpa\xadthy. One lady needed sponges in\xadserted 10 cm deep in her stom\xadach wound. One man was afraid of nee\xaddles and could be heard scream\xading from half the rooms on the floor as nurses spent 30 min\xadutes at\xadtempt\xading to in\xadsert an IV into his hand. None of this is un\xadex\xadpected, but ac\xadtu\xadally see\xading how you re\xadspond to it in re\xadal\xadity is quite differ\xadent try\xading to guess.</p><p>I re\xadsponded by ex\xadpe\xadrienc\xading prodi\xadgious amounts of phan\xadtom pain and em\xadpathic res\xado\xadnance till my brain melted.</p><p>Till I met this el\xadderly old lady there who was the sweet\xadest thing and I asked her if I could do my 3-day case study on her, where I’d in\xadter\xadview her for an hour ev\xadery day. She was the ab\xadsolute pin\xadna\xadcle of grand\xadmoth\xaderly wis\xaddom and warmth. And in re\xadturn, I kept her com\xadpany. Her hus\xadband and child had trag\xadi\xadcally passed away in re\xadcent years. No one else came to visit. Our con\xadver\xadsa\xadtions were an oa\xadsis in our day. We held hands while we talked about her youth, her fam\xadily, and the joys of life as she had found it. Her mind was sharp. Her eyes were clear. But when I came back on the third day, her bed was empty—she had passed away from liver can\xadcer that night.</p><p>I went home, lay down in bed and cried.</p><p>I also con\xadcluded I wasn’t cut out to be a doc\xadtor. But then I thought, maybe I could still be a sur\xadgeon in\xadstead. There was a sec\xadond part to the pre-med track. A two week course at the morgue. Maybe that was my call\xading.</p><p>So I walked into the morgue where in\xaddi\xadvi\xadd\xadual hu\xadman body parts were sorted in IKEA-es\xadque plas\xadtic con\xadtain\xaders: three in\xadtestines here, five livers there, and oh, an en\xadtire ca\xaddaver un\xadder that tarp.</p><p>I stood in shock.</p><p>For 40 min\xadutes straight.</p><p>The cool thing of go\xading in to shock around mul\xadti\xadple doc\xadtors who have seen it all be\xadfore is that they just let you stand there undis\xadturbed. I think I didn’t close my mouth or move a mus\xadcle the en\xadtire time I stood frozen in the mid\xaddle of the morgue. I watched as one stu\xaddent stud\xadied a length of hu\xadman in\xadtestines and re\xadmarked that the end bit was tremen\xaddously squishy and flex\xadible. She then pro\xadceeded to sock pup\xadpet it in mock di\xadalogue to the stu\xaddent next to her. They both burst out laugh\xading be\xadfore re\xadturn\xading to their stud\xadies.</p><p>“Th\xadese are born sur\xadgeons,” I re\xadal\xadized “Some minds are made for cer\xadtain tasks.”</p><p>My mind on the other hand was made to be shuffled out of the morgue af\xadter an hour, handed a glass of wa\xadter, and then plopped on my bike.</p><p>Suffice to say, I didn’t be\xadcome a sur\xadgeon ei\xadther.</p><p>I tried other things though.</p><p>I tried teach\xading. It was great, but I dreaded go\xading over roughly the same ma\xadte\xadrial year af\xadter year.</p><p>I stud\xadied eco\xadnomics, philos\xado\xadphy, math, biol\xadogy, Span\xadish, an\xadthro\xadpol\xadogy, psy\xadchopathol\xadogy, neu\xadro\xadscience, and art.</p><p>I looked into ma\xadte\xadrial en\xadg\xadineer\xading, in\xaddus\xadtrial de\xadsign, 3D art, writ\xading, and char\xadity work build\xading schools in poor coun\xadtries.</p><p>But in the end I picked video games, cause I kept <i>play\xading</i> video games.</p><p>Now play\xading games and de\xadvel\xadop\xading games are two very differ\xadent ac\xadtivi\xadties—I know. So I read through the en\xadtire em\xadployee list of var\xadi\xadous game com\xadpa\xadnies and tried to imag\xadine which role would suit me. De\xadsigner? Pro\xadgram\xadmer? Artist? Sound Eng\xadineer?</p><p>I tried out each one ask\xading my\xadself which po\xadsi\xadtion would be my call\xading. I drafted de\xadsign docs, poked game en\xadg\xadines, sketched dream wor\xadlds, and dis\xadcov\xadered au\xaddi\xadtory dyslexia does not proffer a com\xadpar\xada\xadtive ad\xadvan\xadtage in sound en\xadg\xadineer\xading.</p><p>All these roles made for in\xadtimi\xaddat\xading goals. Game de\xadvel\xadoper po\xadsi\xadtions are as sought af\xadter as Hol\xadly\xadwood jobs. So I took a step back and asked my\xadself if it re\xadally mat\xadtered <i>which </i>of the roles I ended up with. I re\xadal\xadized the thing that mat\xadtered to me was “work on a cool game” while “figure out how to do that” could be a work in progress as I went along.</p><p>So I set the <i>di\xadrec\xadtion</i> of get\xadting any job in the video game in\xaddus\xadtry con\xadtribut\xading to the de\xadvel\xadop\xadment of a AAA video game ti\xadtle. This was my 10 year pro\xadject.</p><p>And 10 years later I got hired as a Data Scien\xadtist at Square Enix, where I an\xada\xadlyzed data from Tomb Raider, Just Cause, Deus Ex, Life is Strange, and Hit\xadman. My re\xadports went to pro\xadduc\xaders and de\xadsign\xaders, who then in\xadte\xadgrated the in\xadfor\xadma\xadtion in their de\xadci\xadsion pro\xadcess on how to de\xadvelop these fran\xadchises fur\xadther.</p><p>I didn’t know that job ex\xadisted when I started out. I didn’t know I’d be par\xadtic\xadu\xadlarly suited for it ei\xadther. And yet I made it. Us\xading this <s>one sim\xadple trick</s> en\xadtirely con\xadvoluted set of heuris\xadtics that hap\xadpen to work for my brain.</p><h1>Do what you love but always tie it back</h1><p>When I came up with all this stuff, I was very tired of fight\xading my brain. I was in col\xadlege, ab\xadsolutely amaz\xading at forc\xading my\xadself to do stuff I hated, and ex\xadactly the level of tor\xadtured you’d ex\xadpect to see as a re\xadsult. Then I de\xadcided life just sucked too much that way, and I’d rather do stuff I want to be do\xading and risk it be\xading dumb than live out my life like that.</p><p>Hon\xadestly, I was a lit\xadtle bit grander about the whole thing. I re\xadal\xadized I wanted to figure out how a Shoshan\xadnah-shaped brain can end up do\xading uniquely Shoshan\xadnah-shaped stuff, and ba\xadsi\xadcally ex\xadplore the part of re\xadal\xadity and pos\xadsi\xadbil\xadity space that can only be ex\xadplored by some\xadone with my ex\xadact brain and cir\xadcum\xadstances.</p><p>This logic can ap\xadply to ev\xadery\xadone. You are the only per\xadson who ever lived and will ever live who can ex\xadplore what it’s like to do stuff ex\xadactly <i>your</i> way, with <i>your</i> brain, and get the ex\xadact re\xadsults <i>you</i> will get.</p><p>So I stared at my brain and no\xadticed I had a bunch of <i>nat\xadu\xadral</i> mo\xadti\xadva\xadtions. Things I wanted to do to farm re\xadward sig\xadnals for my\xadself—the mo\xadti\xadva\xadtional equiv\xada\xadlents of a per\xadpetuum mo\xadbile.

Hon\xadestly, I love to play around as well, es\xadpe\xadcially in video games. But that was my di\xadrec\xadtion already so that didn’t count as a <s>dis\xadtrac\xadtion</s> com\xadpet\xading in\xadter\xadest I was look\xading to wran\xadgle into my grand life plan.</p><p>So how does the ac\xadtual wran\xadgling work?</p><p>Sim\xadple—for ev\xadery ac\xadtivity you nat\xadu\xadrally want to do, try to figure out a way to ap\xadply it to your di\xadrec\xadtion. Your di\xadrec\xadtion is sort of like a <i>theme</i>—if your di\xadrec\xadtion is X and your in\xadter\xadest is Y, then go do X-fla\xadvored Y-things.</p><p>I <i>sus\xadpect</i> this works for brains that are not mine. But ei\xadther way, here are ex\xadam\xadples of how I did it:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Draw\xading</strong>: Buy game art books, study con\xadcept art and 3D mod\xadel\xading, watch mak\xading-of videos of video game artists, learn the ba\xadsics of color the\xadory and com\xadpo\xadsi\xadtion, ex\xadplore vi\xadsu\xadally artis\xadtic games.</p></li><li><p><strong>Work\xading Out</strong>: Gamefy all my work\xadouts, cre\xadate my own re\xadwards and coun\xadters, cre\xadate phys\xadi\xadcal games for my friends, play video games with work\xadout el\xade\xadments, and imag\xadine how to de\xadsign games that truly cap\xadture the joy of var\xadi\xadous work\xadouts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Logic</strong>: Learn pro\xadgram\xadming, poke around in game en\xadg\xadines, cre\xadate di\xada\xadgrams of game de\xadsign el\xade\xadments, play games that are logic-heavy, study game the\xadory (not the same thing, but re\xadally much more rele\xadvant than peo\xadple make it out to be!)</p></li><li><p><strong>Writ\xading</strong>: Write a blog about the psy\xadchol\xadogy of video games (that’s the one that got picked up by the MIT Me\xaddia Lab), chat a lot with peo\xadple about games, write scripts for my youtube videos about games, put game re\xadviews on red\xaddit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Learn\xading New Fields</strong>: For each new topic I stud\xadied I would re\xadflect on how it can be re\xadlated to video games. E.g., af\xadter a class on eco\xadnomics, I checked out the me\xadchan\xadics of Eve On\xadline, when study\xading philos\xado\xadphy I looked into con\xadcep\xadtual rep\xadre\xadsen\xadta\xadtion in video games, when ex\xadplor\xading biol\xadogy or chem\xadistry I’d try to think about how the same top\xadics could be taught or simu\xadlated with games.</p></li><li><p><strong>Read\xading</strong>: Trans\xadform much of my me\xaddia and liter\xada\xadture diet into game-rele\xadvant ma\xadte\xadrial like Dun\xadgeons and Dragons books, isekai sto\xadries, video game blogs, books on video game de\xadsign, and some of the fic\xadtion that many de\xadsign\xaders used as source ma\xadte\xadrial.</p></li><li><p><strong>So\xadcial\xadiz\xading/\u200bOr\xadga\xadniz\xading</strong>: Fo\xadcus on ex\xadpand\xading my so\xadcial play by join\xading and then cre\xadat\xading a clan, start\xading my own youtube chan\xadnel, and later set\xadting up a gam\xading data col\xadlec\xadtion cam\xadpaign (which un\xadex\xadpect\xadedly turned in to my PhD).</p></li></ul><p>Was that enough to fulfill my 10-year plan of con\xadtribut\xading to AAA video games?</p><p>Not en\xadtirely.</p><p>I still got stuck some\xadtimes. When I couldn’t come up with a pro\xadject, or I re\xadally needed to find a job but noth\xading seemed rele\xadvant, or I was un\xadhappy with the thing I was do\xading but didn’t know what to do in\xadstead. I’d look for ad\xadvice, or try to rea\xadson through my prob\xadlems. But some\xadtimes that didn’t work ei\xadther.</p><h1>When all else fails, ap\xadply ran\xaddom search</h1><p>I first used ran\xaddom search as a col\xadlege stu\xaddent be\xadcause I was ac\xadtu\xadally tremen\xaddously and ob\xadstruc\xadtively <i>un\xadhappy. </i>I had tried sleep\xading more, ex\xader\xadcis\xading fre\xadquently, eat\xading healthier, med\xadi\xadtat\xading deeply, ask\xading for help, get\xadting a med\xadi\xadcal check up, spend\xading more time with friends, do\xading vol\xadun\xadteer work, soak\xading up more sun\xadlight, and ev\xadery other self-help, self-care, and self-im\xadprove\xadment tech\xadnique on the face of the earth.</p><p>And I still felt ter\xadrible.</p><p>So ei\xadther there was no way to feel bet\xadter, or the way to feel bet\xadter lay in the space of ac\xadtions I had never tried be\xadfore.</p><p>And thus, I set out to try one new thing ev\xadery day, for 30 days. The new thing could take 30 sec\xadonds, 3 min\xadutes, or 3 hours. It didn’t mat\xadter. All that mat\xadtered was that it was some\xadthing I hadn’t tried be\xadfore. I would de\xadcide on the day what it would be—Some\xadtimes it was a whim. Some\xadtimes it was a pro\xadject. All of it was new.</p><p>Things I tried in\xadcluded …</p><ul><li><p>Eat\xading a new fruit</p></li><li><p>Ex\xadplor\xading a new part of the city</p></li><li><p>Teach\xading my\xadself cartwheels</p></li><li><p>Read\xading about a new topic</p></li><li><p>Talk\xading to a new person</p></li><li><p>Climb\xading a new tree</p></li><li><p>Draw\xading on my window</p></li><li><p>Writ\xading a new fic\xadtion story</p></li><li><p>Try\xading a new figure draw\xading method</p></li><li><p>At\xadtend\xading my first yoga class</p></li><li><p>Buy\xading bal\xadloons and ran\xaddomly hand\xading them out in the street</p></li></ul><p>Was I hap\xadpier af\xadter those 30 days?</p><p>Yeah. Sort of. Not su\xadper happy. But a bit.</p><p>Some things worked. Some things I still do to this day. I ap\xadpar\xadently like eat\xading ba\xadnanas. I like climb\xading ran\xaddom ob\xadjects. I like meet\xading new peo\xadple. Mostly I dis\xadcov\xadered that <i>nov\xadelty in it\xadself</i> ac\xadtu\xadally makes me hap\xadpier and is a nu\xadtri\xadent I can be\xadcome low on, and this can make me sad.</p><p>I think the ran\xaddom search did some\xadthing else as well though: It gave me prac\xadtice in just <i>do\xading</i> stuff, and speci\xadfi\xadcally in do\xading <i>weird</i> stuff, and then also in notic\xading what the <i>genre</i> of weird stuff is that my brain likes to do.</p><p>But how did this help me move along in my life di\xadrec\xadtion?</p><p>I think it loos\xadened me up, in\xadcreased the Over\xadton win\xaddow of what I felt was pos\xadsi\xadble, and made me feel I was free to do things in the world that I wanted—Like send\xading in my CV for a Lo\xadcal\xadiza\xadtion Tester job at Elec\xadtronic Arts the next month. They offered me the job at the end of the in\xadter\xadview… if I was will\xading to move to Spain within three weeks. Some\xadhow that didn’t seem stranger than ran\xaddomly hand\xading out bal\xadloons in the city cause I felt like it. So I said yes.</p><p>My guess is that ran\xaddom search is a way to get your brain un\xadstuck. I think it’s similar to how artists may doo\xaddle to warm up be\xadfore a ses\xadsion. Or how peo\xadple like to drink al\xadco\xadhol to dis\xadin\xadhibit them\xadselves. Ex\xadcept it ap\xadplies to all of life, and gets you look\xading at the world with a ques\xadtion mark on your brain, won\xadder\xading what tiny new thing you could do to\xadday.</p><p>Over\xadall, these were mostly sto\xadries about my life, but the sto\xadries illus\xadtrate the les\xadsons I wish I had learned a lot ear\xadlier and a lot faster. Speci\xadfi\xadcally, if you don’t know what to do with your life, con\xadsider pick\xading a di\xadrec\xadtion in\xadstead of a goal, then em\xadbrace your nat\xadu\xadral mo\xadti\xadva\xadtions, in\xaddulging them while bend\xading them to\xadward your life di\xadrec\xadtion.</p><p>And when all else fails, ap\xadply ran\xaddom search.</p>\n</event_details>\n\nAnalyze how this event would impact your emotional state.

Your task is to suggest 5 songs to add to a playlist based on the given mood and current playlist drawing inspiration from an article on how to make great playlists. Here\'s how to proceed:\n\nFirst, you will be provided with an articke "How to make a good playlist"\n\n<article>\nHow to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer\nDecember 8, 202012:03 AM ET\nBobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle\nThere\'s a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do\'s and don\'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I\'ve since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).\nIt\'s a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it\'s worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you\'re listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?\n"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR\'s Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he\'s performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.\n"A lot of us aren\'t great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.\nBut of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.\nFigure out what you\'re trying to accomplish\nLike speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?\nPlaylists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you\'re going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.\nSponsor Message\nThis is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!\nPick the songs\nOnce you\'ve got your mood in mind, now it\'s time to pick the songs. Don\'t be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you\'re going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It\'s fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they\'ll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).\nBobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you\'re not a professional DJ, he says there\'s no shame in cheating.\n"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.\nCrib from other peoples\' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it\'s all fair game.\nStructure the playlist like a flight\nGenerally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That\'s the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it\'s a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.\nFor instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye\'s "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It\'s nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He\'ll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.\nObviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.\nThis is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It\'s set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I\'m going for.\nSurprise!\nOne of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.\nOf course, "new" doesn\'t have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.\n\n\n</article>\n\nNext, you will be provided with two pieces of information:\n\n1.
