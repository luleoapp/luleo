Health officials and Hamas deny the charge.Later on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on two houses in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza killed at least 16 Palestinians, medics at Al-Awda Hospital in the camp told Reuters. The dead included a paramedic and two local journalists, they added.Northern Gaza, where Israel said in January it had dismantled Hamas\' command structure, is currently the main focus of the military\'s assault in the enclave. Earlier this month it sent tanks into Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya to flush out militants it said had regrouped.Eid Sabbah, director of nursing at Kamal Adwan - which is in Beit Lahiya - told Reuters some staff suffered minor burns after the Israeli strike hit the third floor of the hospital.There were no reports of any casualties at the hospital, which Israeli forces stormed and briefly occupied last week. Israel said it had captured around 100 suspected Hamas militants in that raid. Israeli tanks are still stationed nearby.The health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip called for all international bodies "to protect hospitals and medical staff from the brutality of the (Israeli) occupation".The Israeli military has said its forces are operating in the hospital area based on intelligence about the presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the vicinity."During the operation, it was found that dozens of terrorists were hiding in the hospital, with some even posing as hospital staff," said the military in a statement following Thursday\'s strike.Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said on Thursday that one of its doctors at the hospital, Mohammed Obeid, had been detained last Saturday by Israeli forces. It called for the protection of him and all medical staff who "are facing horrific violence as they try to provide care".The Gaza war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.Israel\'s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians and reduced most of the enclave to rubble, Palestinian authorities say.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabThe launch early on Thursday was the longest ballistic missile test by the North with a flight-time of 87 minutes, according to South Korea.KCNA said the test set new records of its missile capabilities.The missile took off on a sharply lofted trajectory from an area near the North\'s capital and splashed down about 200 km (125 miles) west of Japan\'s Okushiri island, off Hokkaido.It reached an altitude of 7,000 km (4,350 miles)and flew a distance of 1,000 km, the Japanese government said.The so-called lofted trajectory of a projectile flying at a sharply raised angle is intended to test its thrust and stability over much shorter distances relative to the designed range, partly for safety and to avoid the political fallout of sending a missile far into the Pacific.North Korea\'s last ICBM, dubbed the Hwasong-18, was tested in December 2023. Fuelled by solid-propellant and fired from a road launcher, it was also launched at a sharply raised angle and flew for 73 minutes, translating to a potential range of 15,000 km on a normal trajectory.That is a distance that puts anywhere in the mainland United States within range.South Korea announced on Thursday new export controls on materials needed by North Korea to produce solid-fuel missiles.Asked about the missile launch, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said China "has always believed that peace and stability, and promoting a political solution to the peninsula issue are in accordance with the common interests of all sides."Pyongyang\'s latest test came just hours after U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his South Korean counterpart Kim Yong-hyun met in Washington to condemn the North Korean troop deployment in Russia.Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang have directly acknowledged the deployment, but Russia\'s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia on Wednesday questioned why its allies like North Korea could not help Moscow in its war against Ukraine when Western countries claim the right to help Kyiv.South Korea said the deployment directly threatened its security because the North would gain valuable combat experience in a modern warfare and was likely to be rewarded by Moscow with "technology transfers" in areas such as tactical nuclear weapons, ICBMs, ballistic missile submarines, and military reconnaissance satellites.

The area is near where medics said at least 93 people were killed or missing on Tuesday in an Israeli strike Washington called "horrifying".The Israeli military assault that has laid waste to the Gaza Strip and killed tens of thousands of people shows no signs of slowing as Israel wages a new war against Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and its backer the United States tries after a year of failed attempts to broker ceasefires for both.Northern Gaza, where Israel said in January it had dismantled militant group Hamas\' command structure, is currently the focus of the military\'s assault. It sent tanks into Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia earlier this month to flush out Hamas fighters who it said had regrouped in the area.The new operation has killed hundreds of Palestinians. On Wednesday, the Gaza health ministry said at least 30 people were killed in Israeli strikes across the enclave, at least 23 of them in northern areas. Tuesday\'s strike on a house in Beit Lahiya killed 93, including 20 children, medical workers say.An Israeli military official said that airstrike, which demolished a building, was not intended to destroy the structure and was aimed at a person on the roof whom troops had identified as a "spotter" amid heavy fighting.The official, who could not be identified by name, said there were "discrepancies" between the numbers reported dead and what the military had observed but did not elaborate.Israel says its northern assault has killed hundreds militants. Hamas has not said how many fighters have died.CRIES FOR HELPThe assault in the north, in addition to new rules introduced by Israel and a halt to most private food deliveries, has also choked aid and food supplies to their lowest level since the beginning of the war.Israel says it has continued food deliveries into Gaza and blames the United Nations for failing to feed Gazans.Israeli statistics reviewed by Reuters on Wednesday show that aid shipments allowed into Gaza in October remained at their lowest levels since October 2023.Officials in Beit Lahiya issued a statement urging world powers and aid agencies to halt Israel\'s attacks and bring in basic medical supplies, fuel and food, saying the latest military actions had left the area "without food, without water, without hospitals, without doctors."Dr. Eid Sabbah of Beit Lahiya\'s Kamal Adwan hospital told Reuters that bodies and injured people remained trapped under rubble."Whoever is injured, just lies there on the ground and whoever is killed can\'t be transported, except by mule-drawn cart," he said.Israel\'s decision this week to ban the U.N. relief agency UNRWA from operating on its territory could have a disastrous impact on humanitarian efforts in Gaza, U.N. officials said.The Gaza war began after Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that for years ruled the territory, attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.The Israeli assault has decimated Gaza and killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian authorities say.In a separate assault on Lebanese Hezbollah, a Hamas ally which has fired thousands of rockets into Israel killing dozens of people over the past year, Israeli forces have bombarded parts of Beirut and areas of the south of the country. The Israeli assault has killed more than 2,700 people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.NO END IN SIGHTIsrael\'s military and intelligence operations have decapitated the leadership of both Hamas and Hezbollah, including Hezbollah leader and Iran ally, Hassan Nasrallah.Yet Israel\'s wars show no signs of slowing.Israel presses on with assaults on Gaza despite the killing this month of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks whose death was top priority in the war. Israel says 365 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza over the past year, 19 of them since the start of October.U.S. mediators are working on a proposal to halt hostilities between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, starting with a 60-day ceasefire, two sources told Reuters, but Israel pressed its offensive, bombarding Lebanon\'s eastern city of Baalbek.As families fled the Beit Lahiya area last week, parents wheeled children in prams and wooden carts and dragged suitcases through the mud.Dalia al-Kharawat, a mother-of-five from Jabalia, begged locals in Gaza City to let her stay and now sleeps in the open-air car park of a destroyed building with her children."When we need to sleep, we go here in the rubble, the sand, the broken glass.

Difficulties in delivering essential aid have worsened, leading local officials to call for immediate humanitarian support as the region faces severe shortages of food, water, and medical supplies. An Israeli official justified the airstrikes, claiming the intent was focused on specific targets rather than indiscriminate damage. Meanwhile, tensions with Hezbollah persist, as Israeli forces launched strikes in Lebanon in response to rocket attacks. Despite Israel\'s military achievements against militant leadership, conflict continues with no immediate resolution in sight. Families in Gaza face dire living conditions, with many displaced and struggling to find shelter, illustrating the deepening humanitarian crisis amid ongoing violence and instability in the region."\n}'}]

The Israeli military has frequently questioned figures on death toll published by the Hamas-run media office, saying they were often exaggerated.Israel\'s main ally the United States said it was concerned by the high casualty toll, with State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller calling it a "horrifying incident with a horrifying result".U.S. officials have reached out to the Israeli government to ask what happened, Miller told reporters, adding he was aware of reports that many of the dead were children.The U.N. Human Rights Office said it was "appalled" by one of the deadliest single attacks in nearly three months, calling for a prompt, transparent investigation into the circumstances.Video footage obtained by Reuters showed several bodies wrapped in blankets on the ground outside a bombed four-storey building. More bodies and survivors were being retrieved from under the wreckage as neighbours rushed to help with rescue."There are tens of martyrs (dead) - tens of displaced people were living in this house. The house was bombed without prior warning. As you can see, martyrs are here and there, with body parts hanging on the walls," Ismail Ouaida, a witness who was helping to recover bodies, said in the video.Later on Tuesday, Palestinian health officials said, several people were killed and wounded in an Israeli airstrike that hit three houses in Beit Lahiya.TRAPPEDOn Monday, the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said around 100,000 people were trapped in Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun without medical or food supplies. Reuters could not verify the number independently.The health ministry said on Tuesday those wounded in the Beit Lahiya strike could not receive care as doctors had been forced to evacuate the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital."Critical cases without intervention will succumb to their destiny and die," the ministry said in a statement.Gaza\'s emergency service said its operations had come to a halt because of the three-week Israeli assault into northern Gaza. Israel says its campaign is to destroy Palestinian militant group Hamas, whose fighters had regrouped to the area in the year-long war.Hamas\' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel killed 1,200 people and more than 250 hostages were captured and taken into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.The death toll from Israel\'s retaliatory air and ground onslaught in Gaza has exceeded 43,000, the Gaza health ministry said on Monday.Gaza\'s war has kindled wider conflict in the Middle East, with Israel bombing Lebanon and sending forces into its south to disable Iran-backed Hezbollah, a Hamas ally.Tuesday\'s strike came a day after Israel\'s parliament passed a law to ban the U.N. relief agency UNRWA from operating inside the country, alarming some of Israel\'s Western allies who fear it will worsen the already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza.Israeli officials cited the involvement of a handful of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees\' thousands of staffers in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack and a few staffers\' membership in Hamas and other armed groups.UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini described the move as "collective punishment".It was unclear yet how the decision will impact the lives of Palestinians, especially in the Gaza Strip, where the United Nations said most of its 2.3 million people have become internally displaced since the war broke out over a year ago.

The U.S. described the incident as \'horrifying,\' expressing concern over the high casualty figures, and the U.N. Human Rights Office called for an investigation into one of the deadliest attacks in the ongoing conflict. Witnesses reported bodies being recovered from debris, with many still trapped under the rubble and critical medical services stalled. Approximately 100,000 people remain without essential supplies in areas like Jabalia and Beit Hanoun. This attack follows a prolonged conflict that began with Hamas\' attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in 1,200 Israeli fatalities. In retaliation, Israeli military operations in Gaza have resulted in over 43,000 Palestinian deaths. Recently, Israel\'s parliament banned the U.N. relief agency UNRWA from operating in the country, raising concerns about worsening humanitarian conditions in Gaza. The ramifications of this decision on the affected Palestinian population remain uncertain as the war continues to destabilize the region."\n}'}]

I spent the days just prior to my 30th birth\xadday sick with shigel\xadlosis.</p><h1>What? Why?</h1><p>Dy\xadsen\xadtery is an acute dis\xadease in which pathogens at\xadtack the in\xadtes\xadtine. It is most of\xadten caused by the bac\xadte\xadria <i>Shigella</i>. It spreads via the fe\xadcal-oral route. It re\xadquires an as\xadton\xadish\xadingly low num\xadber of pathogens to make a per\xadson sick – so it spreads quickly, es\xadpe\xadcially in bad hy\xadgienic con\xaddi\xadtions or any\xadwhere wa\xadter can get tainted with fe\xadces.</p><p>It kills about 70,000 peo\xadple a year, 30,000 of whom are chil\xaddren un\xadder the age of 5. Al\xadmost all of these cases and deaths are among very poor peo\xadple.</p><p>The pri\xadmary mechanism by which dysen\xadtery kills peo\xadple is de\xadhy\xaddra\xadtion. The per\xadson loses fluids to di\xadar\xadrhea and for what\xadever rea\xadson (lack of knowl\xadedge, en\xadergy, wa\xadter, etc) can\xadnot re\xadgain them suffi\xadciently. Shigella bac\xadte\xadria are in\xadcreas\xadingly re\xadsis\xadtant to an\xadtibiotics. A dis\xadease eas\xadily treat\xadable by lots of fluids and an\xadtibiotics is be\xadcom\xading more lethal.</p><p>Can some\xadone do some\xadthing?</p><h2>The deal with hu\xadman challenge trials</h2><p>Clini\xadcal tri\xadals in gen\xaderal are ex\xadpen\xadsive to run but pretty com\xadmon; clini\xadcal tri\xadals <i>where you are given the dis\xadease </i>– “challenged”, AKA “hu\xadman challenge tri\xadals” – are very rare. The reg\xadu\xadlar way to in\xadves\xadti\xadgate a pos\xadsi\xadble treat\xadment is to make a study plan, then find peo\xadple who have the dis\xadease and offer to en\xadroll them in the ex\xadper\xadi\xadmen\xadtal treat\xadment. Challenge tri\xadals are less com\xadmon, but of\xadten more valuable for re\xadsearch – shigel\xadlosis is a fast-act\xading dis\xadease that is im\xadmi\xadnently treat\xadable by an\xadtibiotics and un\xadcom\xadmon in the US. It would be very difficult to test an al\xadter\xadna\xadtive shigel\xadlosis treat\xadment in the US in the con\xadven\xadtional way, but it’s a great can\xaddi\xaddate for challenge tri\xadals.</p><p>I’d signed up for email alerts on up\xadcom\xading challenge tri\xadals at the nearby Univer\xadsity of Mary\xadland, and got one about an up\xadcom\xading study. It caught my eye that it was for a phage-based treat\xadment. Bac\xadte\xadriophages are re\xadally promis\xading an\xadtibac\xadte\xadrial medicines, not to men\xadtion what I’d stud\xadied as an un\xadder\xadgrad.</p><p>Here’s the thing: you re\xadally only get good med\xadi\xadcal re\xadsearch out of hu\xadman sub\xadjects. Also, I could use $4000 and this seemed like a cool way to spend a cou\xadple weeks and help out med\xadi\xadcal re\xadsearch. So I signed up, got a check-in gen\xaderal health ap\xadpoint\xadment, and shortly af\xadter, was told I was in. I made plans to spend my 30<sup>th</sup> birth\xadday in a dysen\xadtery ward.</p><h2><strong>Dy\xadsen\xadtery: it’s a mod\xadern disease</strong></h2><p>Many of you read\xading this will know about dysen\xadtery from the 1971 simu\xadla\xadtion game The Ore\xadgon Trail (or its later ver\xadsions). The ac\xadtual Ore\xadgon Trail was a net\xadwork of trails and the cor\xadre\xadspond\xading mi\xadgra\xadtion of mostly-white pi\xado\xadneers, mov\xading on foot and on ox-drawn wagon from the east\xadern US to the west\xadern US be\xadtween 1830 and 1869. About 400,000 peo\xadple* crossed the Ore\xadgon Trail in this pe\xadriod, and a lot of them were on similar trails – a bunch of stressed and mal\xadnour\xadished peo\xadple, trav\xadel\xading in close quar\xadters with their fam\xadi\xadlies, stop\xadping and poop\xading near the same trails and creeks with no re\xadgard for wa\xadter safety – dis\xadeases spread <i>very </i>fast in these con\xaddi\xadtions. From these and other stres\xadsors, about 65,000 peo\xadple died in this 40-year pe\xadriod.</p><p>Stated an\xadother way, more peo\xadple die from dysen\xadtery <i>now, ev\xadery year </i>than <i>ever died from any cause</i> on the Ore\xadgon Trail. So let’s calm down about the Ore\xadgon Trail, okay?</p><p>*Lots of peo\xadple use this 400,000 num\xadber but I can’t figure out where it came from and if this is refer\xadring to in\xaddi\xadvi\xadd\xadu\xadals or fam\xadi\xadlies – I’ve seen sources in\xaddi\xadcate it was ei\xadther. If it was fam\xadi\xadlies, it was prob\xada\xadbly count\xading the men who were “the pi\xado\xadneers” and then be\xading like “oh and there were women and kids there also, I guess.” But maybe it was in\xaddi\xadvi\xadd\xadu\xadals? Or maybe some\xadone just made this up? Again, no idea where it came from. You gotta be care\xadful ev\xadery time any\xadone tells you a num\xadber. It’s so bad out there. The only thing worse than some\xadone tel\xadling you a num\xadber is when they don’t tell you a num\xadber.</p><h1><strong>Get\xadting ready</strong></h1><p>A week or so be\xadfore I went, I’d been pointed to <a href="https://x.com/wokeglobaltimes/status/1510768591012085768">Jake Eberts’s twit\xadter thread</a>. Jake Eberts also par\xadti\xadci\xadpated in a challenge trial for a dysen\xadtery vac\xadcine, also I think at UMD and the same Bal\xadti\xadmore fa\xadcil\xadity I was at, where he got very sick and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paigeskinner/man-twitter-dysentery-trial">went viral</a> for livetweet\xading the ex\xadpe\xadrience. He started a fundraiser for dysen\xadtery re\xadlief and got a lot of peo\xadple to sign up for clini\xadcal tri\xadals them\xadselves, and now he works for <a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/">1DaySooner</a>, pre\xadmier “hey, hu\xadman challenge tri\xadals are cool” ad\xadvo\xadcates.</p><p>I read his twit\xadter thread and sent my friends this meme:</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="(chuckles) I\'m in danger." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/inHiHHGs6YqtvyeKp/nqx5ptavn5ihobdwyovu" /></p><p>I brought <i>In\xadfinite Jest</i>, which I was part\xadway through and was a lot more through (but still not done) by the time I was discharged. (I’m writ\xading this while trav\xadel\xading, and in a fit of poor timing I fi\xadnally finished it on the plane ride in, which means I now have a gi\xadant brick of a book to carry around in my suit\xadcase.) My friend Ozy said that <i>In\xadfinite Jest</i> was a re\xadally good book for read\xading in a dysen\xadtery ward.</p><p>I thought, oh, that’s in\xadter\xadest\xading, you know, a lot of the char\xadac\xadters <i>are </i>pretty mis\xader\xadable and liv\xading in a con\xadtrol\xadling in\xadsti\xadtu\xadtion of some kind. Then I re\xadmem\xadbered this one pas\xadsage, where cir\xadcum\xadstances have forced a char\xadac\xadter into with\xaddraw\xading from heroin alone, holed up for days in a pub\xadlic bath\xadroom:</p><blockquote><p>Time be\xadgan to pass with sharp edges. Its pas\xadsage in the dark or dim-lit stall was like time be\xading car\xadried by a pro\xadces\xadsion of ants, a gleam\xading red mar\xadtial column of those mil\xadi\xadtaris\xadtic red South\xadern-U.S. ants that build hideous tall boiling hills, and each vile gleam\xading ant wanted a minus\xadcule lit\xadtle por\xadtion of Poor Tony’s flesh in com\xadpen\xadsa\xadtion as it helped bear time slowly for\xadward down the cor\xadri\xaddor of true With\xaddrawal. By the sec\xadond week in the stall time it\xadself seemed the cor\xadri\xaddor, lightless at ei\xadther end. After more time time then ceased to move to be moved or be move-through\xadable and as\xadsumed a shape above and apart, a huge, must-feathered, or\xadange-eyed wingless fowl hunched in\xadcon\xadti\xadnent atop the stall, with a kind of watch\xadful but deeply un\xadcar\xading per\xadson\xadal\xadity that didn’t seem keen on Poor Tony Krause as a per\xadson at all, or to wish him well. Not one lit\xadtle bit. It spoke to him from atop the stall, the same things, over and over. They were un\xadre\xadpeat\xadable. Noth\xading in even Poor Tony’s grim life-ex\xadpe\xadrience pre\xadpared him for the ex\xadpe\xadrience of time with a shape and an odor, squat\xadting; and the wors\xaden\xading phys\xadi\xadcal symp\xadtoms were a spree at Bon\xadwit’s com\xadpared to time’s black as\xadsurances that the symp\xadtoms were merely hints, sign\xadposts point\xading up at a larger, far more dire set of With\xaddrawal phe\xadnom\xadena that hung just over\xadhead by a string that un\xadrav\xadeled steadily with the pas\xadsage of time. It would not keep still and would not end; it changed shape and smell.</p></blockquote><p>I was forced to agree that <i>In\xadfinite Jest </i>was in\xaddeed prob\xada\xadbly a pretty good choice.</p><h1><strong>Two days un\xadtil challenge</strong></h1><p>Check\xading in, ev\xadery\xadone’s bags were checked. I got the im\xadpres\xadsion they re\xadally didn’t want some kind of bad out\xadcome where they had to call cops into a ward where ev\xadery\xadone was run\xadning around with the bloody flux, which, fair enough. They did take away my craft scis\xadsors. I didn’t end up knit\xadting so it wasn’t a big deal but like I’m pretty sure I’ve taken those on air\xadplanes be\xadfore. Okay. </p><p>We were as\xadsigned a num\xadber (I was just on this side of di\xadv\xadinity at No. 107), given a plas\xadtic wrist\xadband, and shown to our rooms. We were also given two pairs of scrubs which were to be our main clothes on the ward – less risk of ru\xadin\xading hard-to-laun\xadder clothes in the more messy phases of the study – though it did mean 15 peo\xadple hav\xading to co\xador\xaddi\xadnate laun\xaddry ev\xadery day.</p><figure><div class="imgonly"><img alt="My hospital bed with folded scrubs atop, a cup of coffee, and copy of Infinite Jest set on the adjustable bedside table." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/inHiHHGs6YqtvyeKp/kec3xlhrewimyjvcxcxb" /></div><figcaption>Where I made my stand</figcaption></figure><p>The ward was more of a retrofitted office build\xading than a hos\xadpi\xadtal. It con\xadsisted of some spaces for nurses and test\xading, about 6 bed\xadrooms of var\xadi\xadous sizes (each with their own half-bath), two sep\xada\xadrate ar\xadeas with two shower stalls each, a “kitchen” with snacks and where the meals were de\xadliv\xadered to, a closet with washer and dryer, and a rec room with couches and a TV and a pool and foos\xadball table.</p><p>There were about 16 peo\xadple on the ward, an even mix of men and women. Most of them were Bal\xadti\xadmore lo\xadcals; many of them had done other tri\xadals be\xadfore. We were fully al\xadlowed to so\xadcial\xadize – dysen\xadtery is, again, in\xadfec\xadtious through the fe\xadcal-oral route, hand san\xadi\xadtizer was sta\xadtioned all over the place but there wasn’t a huge con\xadcern that we’d in\xadfect each other or even the nurses.</p><p>Life on the ward is very chill. I was wor\xadried about be\xading bored, but I’d for\xadgot\xadten that I spend most of my wak\xading hours on the com\xadputer any\xadway, so it re\xadally wasn’t a prob\xadlem.

I would de\xadscribe the fla\xadvor when drenched with table syrup as “weird.”</p><p>Like, you can <i>tell </i>the per\xadson plan\xadning that menu was like “okay, pan\xadcakes and ba\xadcon… And wait, crap, some\xadthing with pro\xadtein for the veg\xade\xadtar\xadi\xadans.” But again, I’ve eaten worse for things I’ve ac\xadtu\xadally paid for in\xadgre\xaddi\xadents for, and I was definitely eat\xading bet\xadter in terms of va\xadri\xadety and vol\xadume than I did at home. I’m not com\xadplain\xading.</p><h1>One day be\xadfore challenge: the age of phage</h1><p>This study was sort of an over-time test – ideally the first of a few, where we’d get phages be\xadfore (un\xadless we were in the con\xadtrol group), dur\xading, and af\xadter the “challenge” (the shigella) to see if they had any effect at all – if it did, later stud\xadies could de\xadter\xadmine if you could just drink the phage af\xadter get\xadting sick, or if it would work best as a pro\xadphy\xadlac\xadtic, or etc. We drank a chalky buffer solu\xadtion to neu\xadtral\xadize stom\xadach acid and give the bac\xadte\xadriophages (and later, the bac\xadte\xadria) a bet\xadter chance at mak\xading it to the in\xadtes\xadtine.</p><p>What do the solu\xadtions taste like? Ba\xadsi\xadcally all salty fluid with slight min\xaderal nu\xadance, from the buffer. Phages are known to be pretty taste\xadless so I didn’t ex\xadpect any\xadthing else.</p><h2>Bac\xadte\xadriophage ther\xadapy: send\xading a cat af\xadter mice</h2><p>A bac\xadte\xadriophage is a virus that in\xadfects bac\xadte\xadria. They were dis\xadcov\xadered shortly af\xadter bac\xadte\xadria them\xadselves were re\xadally pinned down – micro\xadscopes were fi\xadnally pow\xader\xadful enough to make out bac\xadte\xadria, and vi\xadsion\xadar\xadies like Robert Koch and Louis Pas\xadteur were pin\xadpoint\xading that these lit\xadtle noth\xading-pin\xadpricks were in fact the source of dis\xadeases. (For more on the dis\xadcov\xadery of the micro\xadbial world, see <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/07/through-the-looking-glass">“Through the Look\xading Glass and what Zhe\xadludev Et Al. (2024) Found There”</a>, my re\xadcent piece in As\xadter\xadisk Magaz\xadine.)</p><p>In 1917, Félix d’Hérelle found an agent that kil\xadled cholera bac\xadte\xadria, which passed through a fine filter, and which could re\xadpro\xadduce – a liv\xading agent that kil\xadled bac\xadte\xadria, but that was it\xadself smaller than a bac\xadte\xadria.</p><p>d’Hérelle re\xadal\xadized right away this sub\xadstance which kil\xadled bac\xadte\xadria, and which peo\xadple had ap\xadpar\xadently been drink\xading, had po\xadten\xadtial as medicine. He bred pathogenic bac\xadte\xadria in vats and added solu\xadtions, and waited un\xadtil the cloudy brother of bac\xadte\xadria turned clear – then offered this liquid to sick pa\xadtients. Many of them, sure enough, re\xadcov\xadered. I was (un\xadless I was in the con\xadtrol group) walk\xading in his\xadtor\xadi\xadcal foot\xadsteps. Dy\xadsen\xadtery was the first hu\xadman dis\xadease ever treated with phage medicine.</p><p>Send\xading a phage af\xadter bac\xadte\xadria is like send\xading a cat af\xadter mice. Phages are small, tar\xadgeted, well-adapted hunters of spe\xadcific bac\xadte\xadria. There is no way for them to in\xadfect a hu\xadman cell like a hu\xadman virus would – they are com\xadpletely spe\xadcial\xadized. Phages are already in the body, along with their bac\xadte\xadrial hosts – so you’re not in\xadtro\xadduc\xading a rad\xadi\xadcally new agent – and the im\xadmune sys\xadtem tends to play well with them.</p><p>Phage are used widely in some parts of the world – the Repub\xadlic of Ge\xador\xadgia and Poland both sell phage over-the-counter, for use in say in\xadtesti\xadnal con\xaddi\xadtions or wounds, and have <a href="https://www.phagetherapycenter.com/">clinics for per\xadson\xadal\xadized treat\xadment</a>. In the US, phage ther\xadapy is an ex\xadtremely rare spe\xadcialty, some\xadtimes even fal\xadling un\xadder the um\xadbrella of natur\xadopa\xadthy. (A phage be\xading a nat\xadu\xadral bioac\xadtive product.)</p><p>Why would you use an\xadtibiotics in\xadstead of phages, or vice versa?</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Phages</td><td>An\xadtibiotic\xads</td></tr><tr><td>Tar\xadgeted – a phage at\xadtacks one species or one strain of bac\xadte\xadria <br />Easy to find us\xadable new ones <br />More fin\xadnicky (e.g. less sta\xadble) <br />Preda\xadtor-prey phar\xadma\xadcoki\xadnet\xadics <br /><br />Mostly spread where the bac\xadte\xadria are<br />Very few side effect\xads</td><td>Broad-spec\xadtrum<br /><br />Hard to find us\xadable new ones <br />Shelf sta\xadble <br />Reg\xadu\xadlar blood-elimi\xadna\xadtion-curve phar\xadma\xadcoki\xadnet\xadics <br />Sys\xadtemic; en\xadter the blood\xadstream <br />Some\xadtimes-se\xadri\xadous side effect\xads</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>What if the bac\xadte\xadria be\xadcome re\xadsis\xadtant to the phages too?</p><p>Well, that can hap\xadpen eas\xadily – prob\xada\xadbly even eas\xadier than with an\xadtibiotics. Cells have been duk\xading it out with viruses since the be\xadgin\xadning of life.

This tasted like bak\xading soda and salt with no par\xadtic\xadu\xadlar nu\xadance, nor would I ex\xadpect nu\xadance; the dose was some 1300 or\xadganisms – as in 1300 in\xaddi\xadvi\xadd\xadual cells of bac\xadte\xadria, count ’em. A pre\xadpos\xadter\xadously scant micro\xadbial in\xadnocu\xadlum, even for de\xadvoted par\xada\xadsites it of\xadten takes on the or\xadder of mil\xadlions of or\xadganisms to lodge an in\xadfec\xadtion – but shigella is re\xadmark\xadably tena\xadcious. It would only have taken 10-200. This was overkill – a dose that WILL make you sick, un\xadless you’re pro\xadtected. All the par\xadti\xadci\xadpants drank.</p><h2>The wait\xading game</h2><p>Shigella has a 24-72 hour in\xadcu\xadba\xadtion pe\xadriod, maybe 12-96 hours on the far ends.</p><p>Per\xadhaps ow\xading to quirks of my own psy\xadche, whose ori\xadgins I’m sure we don’t need to ex\xadplore here, I find it re\xadas\xadsur\xading to have refer\xadence ex\xadpe\xadriences to con\xadve\xadniently bench\xadmark the rest of my life by.

Shigella bac\xadte\xadria in\xadvades the body via the di\xadges\xadtive canal, and in\xadfects the in\xadtestines – both small and large. It re\xadleases a toxin that fa\xadcil\xadi\xadtates its in\xadfec\xadtion of other parts of the in\xadtes\xadtine and its even\xadtual repli\xadca\xadtion. It’s an in\xadtra\xadcel\xadlu\xadlar pathogen – some bac\xadte\xadria, like all viruses, ac\xadtu\xadally en\xadter the host’s cell and repli\xadcate in\xadside there.</p><p>Shigella ac\xadtu\xadally prefers to in\xadvade the <i>out\xadside </i>(or should I say the in\xadside?) of in\xadtesti\xadnal cells. But the body is a locked-down sys\xadtem with its own guard force, the im\xadmune sys\xadtem, keep\xading the dirty ex\xadter\xadnal en\xadvi\xadron\xadment sep\xada\xadrate from the ster\xadile in\xadside en\xadvi\xadron\xadment. Shigella in the di\xadges\xadtive tract re\xadally wants to poke through that line of in\xadtesti\xadnal cells and get at them from the other side.</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="How does Shigella get to the outside of the intestinal cell layer?" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/inHiHHGs6YqtvyeKp/gnwf10xvxzucu4ujtujw" /></p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigella_flexneri">Wikipe\xaddia ex\xadplains:</a></p><blockquote><p>Once in\xadside of the colon, <i>S. flexneri</i> can pen\xade\xadtrate the ep\xadithe\xadlium in three ways: <br />1) The bac\xadterium can al\xadter the tight junc\xadtions be\xadtween the ep\xadithe\xadlial cells, al\xadlow\xading it to cross into the sub-mu\xadcosa. <br />2) It can pen\xade\xadtrate the highly en\xaddo\xadcytic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfold_cell">M cells</a> that are dis\xadpersed in the ep\xadithe\xadlial layer and cross into the sub-mu\xadcosa. <br />3) After reach\xading the sub-mu\xadcosa, the bac\xadte\xadria can be phago\xadcy\xadtosed by macrophages and in\xadduce apop\xadto\xadsis, cell death.

Okay, imag\xadine there’s a block\xadade of tightly parked po\xadlice cars fac\xading you and you and your bud\xaddies need to go get to their trunks so you can hide in them. Here are 3 ways to do this:</p><ol><li><p>Push the po\xadlice cars to the side so you can walk be\xadtween them</p></li><li><p>Look for the po\xadlice cars with the biggest doors, so that you can squeeze through the car and leave through their trunk (or I guess prob\xada\xadbly just stay in the trunk at that point)</p></li><li><p>Get your\xadself and your bud\xaddies ar\xadrested, then when they send backup po\xadlice vans to push through the po\xadlice to ar\xadrest all of you, run through the cracks in the block\xadade that those vans open up. Then go to the trunks of the origi\xadnal cop cars.</p></li></ol><p>And then once you’re in\xadside the car, you can open the doors be\xadtween the cop cars (they’re slid\xading doors) and then travel lat\xader\xadally be\xadtween the cop cars.

Differ\xadent strains of <i>E. coli</i> – known to have slightly differ\xadent prop\xader\xadties, but thought to be all slight vari\xada\xadtions on the same ba\xadsic species – turned out to have only <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2974192/">20% of their genes</a> in com\xadmon. (Hu\xadmans and our clos\xadest rel\xada\xadtives, chim\xadpanzees, have al\xadmost all of our genes in com\xadmon* and still aren’t con\xadsid\xadered as the same <i>genus</i>.)</p></li><li><p><i>Shigella </i>is in that um\xadbrella of shared genes – a se\xadcret fam\xadily mem\xadber known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon_in_disguise">taxon in dis\xadguise</a>. It’s more similar to many <i>E. co\xadlis </i>than some <i>E. co\xadli</i>s.</p></li></ul><p>For most species, the pro\xadce\xaddure at this point would be to throw in the towel and re\xadclas\xadsify – <i>Escher\xadichia coli spp. shigella</i>, per\xadhaps. But in this case, shi\xadga\xadtoxin-pro\xadduc\xading <i>Shigella </i>and other pathogenic <i>Escher\xadichia coli </i>have differ\xadent enough clini\xadcal pre\xadsen\xadta\xadtions that the dis\xadtinc\xadtion is still med\xadi\xadcally valuable, so ac\xadcu\xadrate nomen\xadcla\xadture has bowed its head to prac\xadti\xadcal\xadity.

I didn’t try very hard to find the ac\xadtual similar met\xadric be\xadtween them. It’s what I was tel\xadling you about num\xadbers. You gotta watch out.</p><h1><strong>Let’s re\xadally learn about Shigella pathogenesis</strong></h1><p>Some 24 hours in, the first peo\xadple started go\xading down. Via word of mouth I heard the phrase “Ex\xador\xadcist-style pro\xadjec\xadtile vom\xadit\xading” used to de\xadscribe some\xadone in the next room over, a de\xadscrip\xadtion whose ac\xadcu\xadracy I for\xadtu\xadnately can\xadnot ver\xadify. Most peo\xadple were in their rooms all day any\xadhow, but the crowd in the kitchen at meal\xadtimes or show\xading up for morn\xading dos\xading got thin\xadner.</p><p>I re\xadally held out. Go\xading to bed at end of the sec\xadond night, I felt okay, but couldn’t sleep well – nerves, I thought, or the faint dis\xadtorted un\xadpleas\xadant bod\xadily noises from other parts of the ward. I maybe man\xadaged a cou\xadple hours of sleep by the wee hours.</p><p>48 hours in, I woke up for vi\xadtals and dos\xading at 6 AM and started feel\xading re\xadally faint on the short walk to the next room. I stum\xadbled over to the toi\xadlet. Off to the races!</p><p>I should be clear in this sec\xadtion that I was in as close to zero long-term dan\xadger as you can get with dysen\xadtery, which is damn close – this was in a con\xadtrol\xadled set\xadting with doc\xadtors and nurses, mon\xadi\xadtor\xading my con\xaddi\xadtion reg\xadu\xadlarly, with a known pathogen with a known cure. In this case, we weren’t ex\xadpected to lan\xadguish in in\xaddefinite mis\xadery – they wanted to see if we got sick and then how sick we got, yes, but only up to a point, at which point they would “call it” – ad\xadminister reg\xadu\xadlar an\xadtibiotics and end our ex\xadper\xadi\xadmen\xadtal treat\xadment.</p><p>All I had to do was let the time pass.</p><p>The next few hours were very bad. Sur\xadpris\xadingly, the gas\xadtroin\xadtesti\xadnal symp\xadtoms were not much of a prob\xadlem for me – I had them, but it wasn’t much worse than those of reg\xadu\xadlar food poi\xadson\xading. I didn’t throw up. I just wanted to go back to sleep.</p><p>But sleep wasn’t com\xading.</p><p>First was the plague of chills. The in\xadsti\xadtu\xadtional cot\xadton blan\xadkets did noth\xading; four of them also did noth\xading, as if there was no heat to hold in. Freez\xading, tooth-clat\xadter\xading cold.</p><p>Within an hour came the plague of joint pain. It sank in rather quickly and was all in the lower ex\xadtrem\xadities – hips, legs. Any more than one blan\xadket be\xadcame too heavy to bear hav\xading on them, so off they go, freez\xading cold but they weren’t pal\xadpably do\xading any\xadthing any\xadway. Right? I re\xadmem\xadbered read\xading peo\xadple with chronic pain re\xadport\xading that some\xadtimes lay\xading down was worse than other po\xadsi\xadtions, and sure enough sit\xadting up was – some\xadhow – mildly bet\xadter. I situ\xadated the ad\xadjustable bed\xadside table so that I could slump onto it and maybe even sleep like that, but sleep re\xadmained out of reach.</p><p>Time wasn’t shit\xadting so much as drag\xadging, by the bones, over rough pave\xadment, ev\xadery sec\xadond an\xadother six inches, grat\xading, re\xadlentless, sec\xadond af\xadter sec\xadond af\xadter sec\xadond. Time is space in which you are moved for\xadward one way or an\xadother. Pain is an ac\xadtive pro\xadcess. </p><p>Around three hours later, the doc\xadtor came in and judged that I was done – they were call\xading it – symp\xadtomat\xadi\xadcally I had reached the Clini\xadcal End\xadpoint and would be treated. I was handed tylenol and an\xadtibiotics. </p><p>I’d always thought of tylenol as sort of a sec\xadond-rate painkil\xadler, prob\xada\xadbly worth try\xading if you couldn’t find ibupro\xadfen, but damn if that tylenol didn’t work pretty quickly. As soon as I could I went to sleep for like four hours – which, as usual, if you are in a po\xadsi\xadtion of need\xading four hours of sleep, makes a lot of things bet\xadter and more man\xadage\xadable once you can swing it.</p><h1><strong>Out the other side</strong></h1><p>The an\xadtibiotics worked <i>re\xadally</i> quickly. Within hours, the fever had van\xadished and the aches had dwin\xaddled to twinges. Within a cou\xadple days, even the gas\xadtroin\xadtesti\xadnal situ\xada\xadtion was back to nor\xadmal. Other peo\xadple were harder hit, other peo\xadple were just start\xading to get sick – stay\xading van\xadished in their rooms even af\xadter I stuck my head into the kitchen and rec rooms like the first hope\xadful ground\xadhog of spring – and many had been fine the whole time.</p><p>The thing that kills peo\xadple in dysen\xadtery is de\xadhy\xaddra\xadtion and com\xadpli\xadca\xadtions thereof. So part of the re\xadcov\xadery is col\xadlect\xading and mea\xadsur\xading how many fluids were emit\xadted, and then re-ad\xadminis\xadter\xading oral re\xadhy\xaddra\xadtion fluid – a salty liquid served ice-cold – in pre\xadcise ra\xadtios to re\xadplace the bod\xadily fluids lost. A hu\xadman is a se\xadries of tubes with at\xadtached ner\xadvous sys\xadtem and for\xadtu\xadnately I was in the com\xadpany of mas\xadter plumbers.

The Bal\xadti\xadmore\xadans in\xadex\xadpli\xadca\xadbly set off fire\xadworks many nights – maybe the prox\xadim\xadity to July 4<sup>th</sup>? – and this was one of them. Not road\xadside-stand-ground fire\xadworks, but big aerial fire\xadworks. A fel\xadlow sub\xadject found ice cream bars in the kitchen freezer and kindly brought me one as a pre\xadsent. Fire\xadworks aside, it was a quiet day.</p><p>Apolo\xadgies for the de\xadcep\xadtion, reader. Tech\xadni\xadcally speak\xading, the word “dysen\xadtery” usu\xadally refers to a syn\xaddrome, like “psy\xadchosis” or “high blood pres\xadsure”, which can have mul\xadti\xadple causes but which is defined by spe\xadcific symp\xadtoms. The spe\xadcific symp\xadtom of dysen\xadtery is bloody di\xadar\xadrhea. I per\xadson\xadally did not get this par\xadtic\xadu\xadlar symp\xadtom – I be\xadcame sick with <i>shigel\xadlosis </i>but, ac\xadcord\xading to a com\xadmon crite\xadria, did not get <i>dysen\xadtery</i>. I’m sorry for click\xadbait\xading you. In my defense, I would have taken it over the joint pain.</p><h1><strong>Aftermath</strong></h1><p>Twice a day af\xadter an\xadtibiotics, we gave the nurses a stool sam\xadple – these were sam\xadpled and cul\xadtured at some lab to de\xadter\xadmine if shigella was still in there. Two nega\xadtive sam\xadples in a row meant that we were free to go.</p><p>9 days af\xadter com\xading in, I was cleared for re\xadlease. I col\xadlected my scis\xadsors, and, free of dysen\xadtery, was re\xadleased onto the streets of Bal\xadti\xadmore. A year older on pa\xadper.

The author highlights the rapid spread and serious consequences of dysentery, particularly its high fatality rate among vulnerable populations. They describe the purpose of human challenge trials, which involve infecting participants to study treatments more effectively than traditional trials. The author signed up for a phage-based treatment study, intrigued by the potential of bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics, especially in the context of growing antibiotic resistance. Despite concerns, the author spent their 30th birthday in a \'dysentery ward,\' emphasizing the controlled environment of the trial. As shigellosis symptoms began to manifest, they experienced significant discomfort, yet were assured of safety due to medical oversight. The author eventually received effective treatment with antibiotics, highlighting the success of the trial. Reflecting on their experience, the article concludes with a note on the importance of advancing phage therapy as a critical tool in managing antibiotic resistance and the necessity of continued human trials to improve medical research outcomes."\n}'}]
