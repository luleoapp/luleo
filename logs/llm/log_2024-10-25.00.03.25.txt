It highlights the potential benefits of being part of Brics, such as economic cooperation and investment opportunities, which Venezuela seeks amid its ongoing economic crisis. The Venezuelan administration framed Brazil\'s veto as a political maneuver rather than a decision based on economic criteria, suggesting that it reflects historical tensions between the two countries. In response to the veto, Venezuelan officials have called for solidarity among Latin American countries and reiterated their commitment to join international platforms that promote development and mutual support.

The defense sought to portray the brothers as victims of lifelong trauma, while the prosecution focused on the premeditation of the murders and the brothers\' lavish spending habits following the killings. Ultimately, the jury was unable to reach a verdict in the first trial, leading to a retrial where both were convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Asked which candidate had the better approach on the issues, Trump led on the economy - 46% to 38% - and on immigration by 48% to 35%.Immigration also ranked as the No. 1 issue when respondents were asked what the next president should focus on most in their first 100 days in office. Some 35% picked immigration, with 11% citing income inequality and equal 10% shares citing healthcare and taxes.But Trump fared poorly on the question of which candidate was better to address political extremism and threats to democracy, with Harris leading 42% to 35%.

Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, triumphing in the Electoral College even though she won the national popular vote by 2 points.Polls have shown Harris and Trump are neck and neck in those battleground states.The poll gave signs that voters - particularly Democrats - might be more enthused about this year\'s election than they were ahead of the November 2020 presidential election when Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump.Some 79% of registered voters in the poll - including 87% of Democrats and 84% of Republicans - said they were "completely certain" they would cast a ballot in the presidential election. The share of sure-to-vote poll respondents was up from 74% in a Reuters/Ipsos survey conducted Oct. 23-27, 2020, when 74% of Democrats and 79% of Republicans said they were certain to cast ballots.The new poll had a margin of error of 2 percentage points.Harris entered the race in July after Biden ended his reelection effort following a poor debate performance against Trump in June. Trump at the time was widely seen as the frontrunner, partly based on his perceived strength on the economy after several years of high inflation under the Biden administration, which has eased in recent months.Given the close match, the candidates\' efforts to ensure that their supporters actually cast ballots will likely be key in determining the winner. Just two-thirds of U.S. adults voted in the November 2020 election, which was the highest turnout in over a century, according to estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Pew Research Center.Roughly one-third of registered voters are Democrats and one-third Republican, with the balance independents or those who favor third parties, according to an estimate by Pew Research.The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 4,129 U.S. adults online, nationwide, including 3,481 registered voters.

The retaliation could disrupt oil markets and risks igniting a full-blown war between the arch-enemies.On Gaza, Blinken will focus discussions on how to end the war, plans for the enclave after the fighting ends and how to improve humanitarian assistance, said a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.Last week Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin wrote to Israeli officials demanding concrete measures to address the worsening situation in Gaza, or face potential restrictions on U.S. military aid.The official said that in his meetings with Israel and Arab countries Blinken will drill down on "day after" issues, particularly security, governance and reconstruction. Having detailed plans for each of these has been seen as prerequisites for achieving any lasting resolution to the conflict.The secretary of state will also discuss with Israel and other countries how to secure a diplomatic resolution to the conflict with Hezbollah, and will continue Washington\'s conversation with the Israelis about their expected response to Iran\'s missile attack, said the official.BREAKTHROUGH "HARD TO IMAGINE"Experts say Hamas and Israel remain deeply at odds and are unlikely to make significant concessions before the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, which could upend U.S. policy."It\'s very hard to imagine" that Blinken would score a breakthrough this week, said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, given that neither Hamas nor Netanyahu have any urgency to end the war."Taking advantage of the moment is a fundamentally misleading sort of concept in this case because I\'m not sure there is a moment," Miller said.The Biden administration has cast the killing of Sinwar by the Israeli military last week as a possible opening that would finally pave the way to end the Gaza war, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says fighting will continue.Israel is accelerating military operations to push Hezbollah away from its northern border while thrusting into Gaza’s densely packed Jabalia refugee camp in what Palestinians and U.N. agencies fear could be an attempt to seal off northern Gaza from the rest of the enclave.Analysts say Netanyahu may prefer to wait out the end of U.S. President Joe Biden\'s term, which ends in January, and take his chances with the next president, whether Democratic nominee Kamala Harris or her Republican rival Donald Trump. Netanyahu spoke to Trump about the conflict by phone on Saturday, both Trump and Netanyahu\'s office said.A Gaza ceasefire proposal that the U.S. and mediators Egypt and Qatar have worked on for months is no longer feasible, Miller said, and the lack of command and control within Hamas also complicates the negotiation process."The proposal that would be most realistic would be if Blinken came and said \'we\'ll do an all for all\'. You get all the hostages back, and the Israelis will declare a ceasefire," Miller said, cautioning that even that formulation would have many questions that needed to be answered.Speaking to reporters on Monday, deputy State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel insisted that U.S. officials feel "there is an opportunity to move the ball forward" on a ceasefire."I\'m not going to speculate on any immediate end product or outcome (from the trip), but we feel that it is important to engage not just with the Israelis, but also other partners in the region," he said.

An Israeli airstrike on a house in Jabalia killed five people and wounded several others, medics said.The U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA said Israeli authorities were preventing humanitarian missions from reaching areas in the north of the Palestinian enclave with critical supplies, including medicine and food."People attempting to flee are getting killed, their bodies left on the street," UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said on X.Medics at the Indonesian Hospital told Reuters that Israeli troops stormed a school and detained the men before setting it ablaze. The fire reached hospital generators and caused a power outage, they added.Health officials said they had refused orders by the Israeli army, which started a new incursion into the territory\'s north over two weeks ago, to evacuate the three hospitals in the area or leave the patients unattended.Troops remained outside the hospital but did not enter, they said. Medics at a second hospital, Kamal Adwan, reported heavy Israeli fire near the hospital at night."The army is burning the schools next to the hospital, and no one can enter or leave the hospital," said one nurse at the Indonesian Hospital, who asked not to be named.Palestinian health officials said at least 18 people had been killed in Jabalia and eight elsewhere in Gaza in Israeli strikes.The Israeli military said in a statement it was operating against "terrorists and terrorist infrastructure" in the Jabalia area.Troops had helped thousands of civilians to evacuate safely through organised routes, it said. Israel was in contact with the international community and Gaza\'s healthcare system to ensure hospital emergency services were operating, it said.In the past day, troops had dismantled militant infrastructure and tunnel shafts and killed fighters in the Jabalia area, it said.Israel has intensified its campaigns both in Gaza and Lebanon after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week had raised hopes of an opening for ceasefire talks to end more than a year of conflict.It has vowed to eradicate the Hamas militants who formerly controlled Gaza and whose attack on Israel last year triggered the war, but in doing so has laid waste to much of the territory and killed tens of thousands of people. More than 1.9 million people have been left destitute and desperate for food."We are facing death by bombs, by thirst and hunger," said Raed, a resident of Jabalia camp. "Jabalia is being wiped out and there is no witness to the crime, the world is blinding its eyes."FORCED TO LIVE IN TOILETSHadeel Obeid, a supervisor nurse at the Indonesian hospital, said they were running out of medical supplies, including sterile gauze and medications. The water supply has been cut off and there was no food for the fourth consecutive day, she told Reuters.The United Nations said it had been unable to reach the three hospitals in northern Gaza.The U.N. Human Rights Office accused Israeli forces of unlawful interference with humanitarian assistance and issuing orders that were causing forced displacement. It said their conduct "may be causing the destruction of the Palestinian population in Gaza\'s northernmost governate through death and displacement".UNRWA\'S Lazzarini said injured people were lying without care in hospitals that had been hit."UNRWA remaining shelters are so overcrowded, some displaced people are now forced to live in the toilets," he said.Israel says it is getting large quantities of humanitarian supplies into Gaza with land deliveries and airdrops. It also says it has facilitated the evacuation of patients from the Kamal Adwan Hospital.Palestinians say no aid entered northern Gaza areas where the operation is active.Residents and medics said Israeli forces had tightened their siege on Jabalia by positioning tanks in nearby Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya towns and ordering residents to leave.Israeli officials said evacuation orders were aimed at separating Hamas fighters from civilians and denied there was any systematic plan to clear out civilians. It said forces operating in northern Gaza killed scores of Hamas gunmen and dismantled infrastructureHamas accused Israel of carrying out acts of "genocide and ethnic cleansing" to force people to leave northern Gaza.The Hamas armed wing said fighters attacked forces there with anti-tank rockets and mortar fire, and detonated bombs against troops inside tanks and stationed in houses.Elsewhere in the enclave, Israeli strikes killed at least five people in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip and four in two separate strikes in Gaza City, medics said.The slain Sinwar was one of the masterminds of the Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attack on Israeli communities that killed around 1,200 people, with about 253 more taken back to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel\'s subsequent war has killed more than 42,500 Palestinians, with another 10,000 uncounted dead thought to lie under the rubble, Gaza health authorities say.

There was no immediate information on what caused the explosion, or details of any casualties.Panicked crowds clogged the streets and caused traffic jams in some parts of Beirut as they tried to get to neighbourhoods thought to be safer, witnesses said."Residents of Lebanon, the IDF (Israeli military) will begin attacking infrastructure belonging to the Hezbollah Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association - get away from it immediately," the military\'s spokesperson said in a statement on X.Al-Qard al-Hassan - which the U.S. has said is used by Iran-backed Hezbollah to manage its finances - has more than 30 branches across Lebanon including 15 in densely populated parts of central Beirut and its suburbs.There was no immediate statement from the organisation, Hezbollah or the Lebanese government.Asked by journalists whether the branches could be considered military targets, a senior Israeli intelligence official said: "The purpose of this strike is to target the ability of Hezbollah economic function both during the war but also afterwards to rebuild and to rearm ...on the day after."Cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah erupted a year ago when the group began launching rockets in support of Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza.At the start of October, Israel launched a ground assault inside Lebanon in an attempt to stabilise the border region for its citizens who had fled rocket attacks in northern Israel.ESCALATED ATTACKSItem 1 of 7 Khiam, Lebanon, October 20, 2024.

In a call with former U.S. President Donald Trump, the prime minister reiterated that Israel would make decisions based on its own interests, according to a statement from Netanyahu\'s office.Over the last year, Lebanese officials estimate that more than 2,400 people have been killed and more than 1.2 million people displaced. Fifty-nine people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights over the same period, say Israeli authorities.Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostages in the attack on Oct. 7 last year that sparked the war, according to Israeli tallies.

But he described it as an assassination attempt by "Iran\'s proxy Hezbollah" and called it a "grave mistake", as Israel prepares to retaliate for an Iranian missile barrage earlier this month.The strikes came as medics and Hamas media in Gaza, where Israel has been fighting to root out the Palestinian militant group for more than a year, said Israeli bombardments had killed more than 100 people across the coastal enclave and a siege around three hospitals had tightened.Promises by Israel and its enemies Hamas and Hezbollah to keep fighting have chilled hopes that the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on Wednesday might lead to truces in Gaza and Lebanon and prevent further escalation in the Middle East.Officials, diplomats and other sources say that with U.S. elections approaching, Israel is seeking to use intensified military operations to try to shield its borders and ensure its rivals cannot regroup.On Saturday, Israeli planes dropped leaflets over southern Gaza with a picture of Sinwar and the message: "Hamas will no longer rule Gaza".Israeli strikes later on Saturday on a multi-floor building in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya killed at least 73 people and wounded dozens, medics and Hamas media said.The Israeli military is checking reports of casualties from an airstrike in northern Gaza, an Israeli official said, adding that a preliminary examination suggested the numbers had been exaggerated and did not match information it had received.In Beirut\'s southern suburbs, Israel carried out heavy strikes on several locations, leaving thick plumes of smoke hanging over the city into the evening.The strikes targeted "a number of Hezbollah weapons storage facilities and a Hezbollah intelligence headquarters command centre", Israel\'s military said.Israel had issued evacuation orders for four separate neighbourhoods within the suburbs, urging residents to get 500 metres (yards) away, but carried out strikes in other areas as well, witnesses said.Tens of thousands of people have fled the southern suburbs - once a densely populated zone that also housed Hezbollah offices and underground installations - since Israel began regular strikes there about three weeks ago.An Israeli air attack on Sept. 27 killed Hezbollah\'s secretary general Hassan Nasrallah, and strikes nearby have killed other top figures from the Iran-backed group.The United States would like to see Israel scale back some of its strikes in and around Beirut, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said.NEW AREA STRUCKEarlier on Saturday, an Israeli strike killed two people as they were travelling on Lebanon\'s main highway near the Christian-majority town of Jounieh. Israel\'s military said it was looking into the incident.Another strike killed at least four people in Lebanon\'s Bekaa valley, health authorities said. One of them was the mayor of a nearby town, the second mayor to be killed this week.Item 1 of 17 Beirut\'s southern suburbs, October 19, 2024.

On Saturday alone, Hezbollah launched around 200 "projectiles," the Israeli military said.Nearly three weeks ago, Israel launched a ground assault inside Lebanon in an attempt to stabilise the border region for its citizens who had fled the fighting.Israel\'s military said on Saturday said it had destroyed tunnel shafts and underground infrastructure in southern Lebanon. It also said it had killed Hezbollah\'s deputy commander of the Bint Jbeil area on Friday.The Israeli military has opened an investigation into the death of a Hezbollah detainee in Lebanon, Israeli media said.Since October 2023, more than 2,400 people have been killed in Lebanon, most of them in the last month, according to Lebanon\'s health ministry, while 59 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights, according to Israeli authorities.Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and took 250 hostages in the attack that triggered the war, according to Israeli tallies. Israel\'s military response has left more than 42,500 people dead, Palestinian officials say.The Israeli offensive has made most of Gaza\'s 2.3 million people homeless, caused widespread hunger and destroyed hospitals and schools.COGAT, the Israeli military agency that oversees administration in the Palestinian Territories, has stepped up deliveries of aid into Gaza amid international pressure. Israel and the United Arab Emirates made an air drop of aid into southern Gaza on Saturday.Western leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, have said Sinwar\'s death offered a chance for a deal for a truce in Gaza and the release of the remaining hostages.Negotiations for such a deal have been stalled for weeks.

REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab"Iran is Hamas strongest ally, which supports the group with money and weapons, and their blessing is key to who becomes Sinwar\'s successor," said Abouelhoul, managing editor of the state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram in Egypt.He expected Hamas to stick by core demands in future ceasefire talks, chiefly that Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza and stop the war. But it could show more flexibility on some conditions, such as the details of any deal swapping Israeli hostages for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared Sinwar\'s killing a milestone but that the war is not yet over, saying fighting would continue until the hostages are released.Hamas was founded in 1987 and is a branch of the Sunni Islamist Muslim Brotherhood movement. Its decisions are usually taken through consensus in Hamas institutions.With Sinwar dead, the Hamas leadership for Gaza has temporarily passed to his Qatar-based deputy, Hayya.But the ongoing war and communication difficulties might impose limits on just how much day-to-day contact Hayya can have with men on the ground, leaving the armed wing - the Qassam Brigades - in the driving seat, experts say.A Hamas source said Hayya was expected to encounter no problems exercising his role as "de facto Gaza leader". The source noted that Hayya had maintained good relations with the military wing and had been close to both Sinwar and Haniyeh.Akram Attallah, a Palestinian political analyst, said he expected the armed wing to respect Hayya\'s authority - even from afar. He also expected Mohammad Sinwar to emerge as a more significant figure in the armed wing and in Hamas in general.A veteran commander of the Qassam Brigades, Mohammad Sinwar has seldom appeared in public, has long been on Israel\'s most-wanted list and has survived several attempts on his life, Hamas sources said.Hamas-led gunmen killed 1,200 people and abducted another 250 during the Oct. 7 attack, according to Israeli tallies. This prompted an Israeli offensive which, according to Palestinian authorities, has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, laid waste to Gaza, and driven nearly all its population from their homes.Sinwar\'s appointment in August was seen as both a show of defiance and internal unity by Hamas.His close ties to Iran were seen as a factor supporting his candidacy. Both Darwish and Hayya are also seen as close to Tehran, whose support will be vital for Hamas to recover after the war.Meanwhile, the prospects of the prominent former Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal have been clouded by a record of friction with Tehran after his support for the Sunni Muslim-led revolt in 2011 against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.Attallah said Hayya\'s ties to Iran stood him in better stead than Meshaal. But if Iran softened its opposition to Meshaal, he may have a chance, he said.

Can’t predict that that means whoever replaces (Sinwar) will agree to a ceasefire, but it does remove what has been in recent months the chief obstacle to getting one," he said.One senior diplomat working in Lebanon told Reuters that hopes Sinwar\'s death would end the war appeared misplaced."We had hoped, really throughout this, that getting rid of Sinwar would be the turning point where the wars would end ... where everyone would be ready to put their weapons down. It appears we were once again mistaken," the diplomat said.Months of efforts by Israel\'s chief backer the United States to broker ceasefires with Hamas and Hezbollah have failed as Israel has pressed on with its wars, and its arch foe Iran has looked largely powerless to match Israel\'s military might, including U.S. weapons.The conflict has caused the first direct Iranian-Israeli confrontations, including missile attacks on Israel in April and Oct. 1. Netanyahu has vowed to respond to the October attack, which caused little damage. Washington has pressed Israel to limit targets and not strike Iranian energy facilities or nuclear sites.Item 1 of 6 A mourner reacts near the bodies of people who were killed in an Israeli airstrike that destroyed the municipal headquarters in Nabatieh on Wednesday, during a collective funeral held for 13 people in Nabatieh, southern Lebanon, October 18, 2024.

REUTERS/Mohammed Yassin Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabTRACKED AND KILLEDSinwar, Hamas\' overall leader following the assassination of political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, was believed to have been hiding in the warren of tunnels Hamas has built under Gaza over the past two decades.He was killed during a gun battle on Wednesday by Israeli troops initially unaware they had caught their number one enemy, Israeli officials said.The military released drone video of what it said was Sinwar, sitting on an armchair and covered in dust inside a destroyed building. He was tracked by the drone as he lay dying, the video showed. As the drone hovered nearby, the video showed him throwing a stick at it, in an apparent act of desperation.Hamas has not made any comment, but sources within the group have said the indications they have seen suggest Sinwar was indeed killed.He masterminded the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities. Israel responded by invading Gaza, so far killing more than 42,000 people, according to Palestinian officials.Hezbollah, which began firing rockets at Israel in support of its Hamas ally on Oct. 8, is the target of Israel\'s intensifying assault on Lebanon, which has killed more than 2,000 people and displaced 1.2 million.Israel has now killed several of Hamas\' top leaders and in a matter of weeks decapitated the Hezbollah leadership , mainly through air strikes.The killings have dealt a blow to what anti-Israeli forces call the Axis of Resistance: a group of proxy militant groups that Iran has spent decades supporting across the region.Iran showed no sign Sinwar\'s killing would shift its support. "The spirit of resistance will be strengthened," its mission to the United Nations said.Hezbollah was also defiant, announcing "the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with Israel".The Israeli military said on Friday it had also killed Muhammad Hassin Ramal, Hezbollah’s commander of the Tayibe area in southern Lebanon.Families of Israeli hostages said that while the killing of Sinwar was an achievement, it would not be complete while captives are still in Gaza.Avi Marciano, father of Noa Marciano, who was killed in captivity by Hamas, told Israeli broadcaster KAN that "the monster, the one who took her from me, who had the blood of all our daughters on his hands, finally met the gates of hell."

Iran\'s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi landed in Cairo for talks with Egyptian officials as part of a Middle Eastern tour as tension builds.The European Union held its first summit with Gulf states and issued a statement calling for calm: "We underscore the importance of diplomatic engagement with Iran –– to pursue regional de-escalation," it said.Israel shows no signs of easing its military campaigns against Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza despite repeated calls for ceasefires and it has vowed to punish Iran for its Oct. 1 attack.Iran and its Middle East allies -- Lebanon\'s Hezbollah, Hamas, Yemen\'s Houthis and armed groups in Iraq -- say they will not back down in the face of relentless pressure from the most advanced and power military in the region.The mayor of a major town in south Lebanon was among 16 people killed on Wednesday when an Israeli airstrike destroyed its municipal headquarters in the biggest attack on an official Lebanese state building since the Israeli air campaign began.Lebanese officials denounced the incident, which also wounded more than 50 people in Nabatieh, a provincial capital, saying it was proof that Israel\'s campaign against the Hezbollah armed group was now shifting to target the Lebanese state.The Israelis "intentionally targeted a meeting of the municipal council to discuss the city\'s service and relief situation" to aid people displaced by the Israeli campaign, caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said.Israel and Hezbollah have been fighting since the militant group began firing missiles at its arch-foe a year ago in support of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in Gaza.European Union commissioner for crisis management, Janez Lenarcic, said Israel\'s "brutal response" to the Hamas attack that started the war had resulted in a devastating humanitarian crisis in Gaza that was now continuing in Lebanon."Humanitarian workers have been targeted and killed, hundreds of them. There is no security and safety for humanitarian work to be organized in satisfactory manner," he told Reuters on the sidelines of an ASEAN event in Jakarta, describing the provision of humanitarian supplies as "grossly insufficient".US TARGETS HOUTHISThe U.S. said on Wednesday it struck five underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, the latest in more than a dozen U.S. attacks on Houthi-linked targets this month.Iran-aligned Houthi fighters in Yemen who say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Israel\'s year-long war in Gaza have carried out nearly 100 attacks on ships crossing the Red Sea since November.Israel also launched strikes at Syria\'s Mediterranean port city of Latakia early on Thursday, Syrian state media reported.Israeli operations in Lebanon have killed at least 2,350 people over the last year, according to the health ministry, and more than 1.2 million people have been displaced. The death toll does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but includes hundreds of women and children.Around 50 Israelis, both soldiers and civilians, have been killed in the same period, according to Israel.PEACEKEEPERS REPORT MORE FIREIsrael has come under scrutiny for its dealings with U.N. peacekeepers in south Lebanon.The U.N. mission in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said its peacekeepers observed an Israeli tank firing at their watchtower near southern Lebanon\'s Kfar Kela on Wednesday morning. Two cameras were destroyed, and the tower was damaged, UNIFIL said.Israel\'s military said the incident, the latest in a number of attacks that UNIFIL says have targeted its troops, was under investigation."UNIFIL infrastructure sites and forces are not a target and every irregular incident will be thoroughly examined," the military said, adding that Hezbollah has been operating from “sites that have been built within and adjacent to UNIFIL posts for many years."Israel has called on the United Nations to move members of the UNIFIL peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon out of the combat zone for their safety.Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, on a visit to northern Israel near the border, said Israel would not halt its assault on Hezbollah to allow negotiations."We will hold negotiations only under fire.

No! I think there are serious problems in 2020,” Vance said. “So, did Donald Trump lose the election in 2020? Not by the words that I would use.”Trump, the Republican candidate for president in 2024, continues to falsely claim that he lost the 2020 election due to extensive voter fraud, a view shared by millions of his supporters. Numerous inquiries, however, have found no evidence of fraud.During his current run for president, Trump has suggested he will challenge the results if he does not prevail in the Nov. 5 contest against Democrat Kamala Harris, the US vice president.His efforts to overturn the 2020 election led to his indictment by federal and state officials. He still awaits trial in those cases. His refusal to accept the outcome also sparked the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by thousands of his supporters.Vance, a first-term U.S. senator, made headlines when he sidestepped the question during his debate with Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, on Oct. 1, saying he was focused on “the future.”That led Walz to rebuke him. “That’s a damning non-answer,” he said.In Williamsport, Vance said he was not espousing “some crazy conspiracy theory” in arguing Trump won. Instead, he blamed the election outcome on online censorship by large tech companies.Pennsylvania is considered perhaps the most critical of the seven battleground states that will determine the election.
