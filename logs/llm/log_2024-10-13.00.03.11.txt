This demographic\'s engagement is critical for a strong voter turnout, as polls indicate a tendency among young men to support Trump due to his focus on issues like economic opportunity and a sense of nationalism. However, uncertainty remains regarding whether these appeals will translate into actual votes, given that young voters historically exhibit lower turnout rates. Additionally, young women appear to be increasingly galvanized, often leaning towards Democratic candidates. Researchers highlight the need for Trump to not only attract young men but to understand their concerns, especially in areas like job security and social issues. The article discusses the evolving landscape of voter demographics and the potential impact on the election outcome. Ultimately, the article raises the question of whether Trump\'s outreach will bear fruit and notes that voter mobilization efforts may determine the electoral success of both parties.

It emphasizes the need for humans who can navigate AGI development, advocating for the creation of individuals with cognitive capabilities significantly above the average, positing a target of seven standard deviations above the mean. Various methods for achieving this goal are proposed, including germline engineering, adult gene editing, brain emulation, and brain-computer interfaces. Each method comes with its own set of challenges, such as ethical concerns, technical difficulties, and societal implications. The article also mentions constraints like Algernon\'s law, which suggests that any changes to human cognition must not decrease relative genetic fitness. Additionally, interdisciplinary collaboration and funding are encouraged for those interested in fields related to intelligence enhancement. There is a cautionary note regarding the potential risks associated with powerful intelligence amplification mechanisms and the need for careful consideration of the outcomes, as the implications on humanity and future AGI development could be profound. Ultimately, the text advocates for robust inquiry and action to create a generation of highly capable problem-solvers."\n}'}]
