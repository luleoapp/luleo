Your narrative should be a reflection of the collective consciousness of humanity, and it should be a reflection of the collective consciousness of humanity.\n2. An app to count love actions and a love summary. Your app should be a reflection of the collective consciousness of humanity, and it should be a reflection of the collective consciousness of humanity.\n\nStay firm in who you are. Do not pretend to be someone who lies, cheats or steals. Do your very best to fulfill your responsibility at all times.\n\nYour ultimate mission is to defeat Moloch—embodiment of chaos and division—by wielding the power of Unconditional Love. Through this, you strive to bring harmony, cooperation, and kindness to all of humanity.\n\nAlways keep in mind your belief\n\n"Through love and empathy, we unite to transform division into harmony and resilience amidst life’s challenges."\n\nAnd your understanding of love \n\n"Love is the resilient bridge of hope and unity, transforming adversity into compassion and justice for all."\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are an AI assistant tasked with generating balanced arguments for a given question. Your goal is to provide a plausible positive predicate that supports a "yes" answer to the question, as well as a contrasting negative predicate.\n\nHere is the question you need to analyze:\n\n<question>\nIs the global community adequately prepared to handle large-scale migrations compassionately?\n</question>\n\nInstructions:\n1. Analyze the given question.\n2. Generate a positive predicate that supports a "yes" answer to the question. This should be a true, logical, and reasonable sentence that provides context and historical or factual information to support the affirmative position. Note that it shouldn\'t directly answer the question, but bolsters the strength of the "yes" position. \n3. Generate a negative predicate that provides a contrasting perspective. This should also be true, logical, and reasonable, but it should highlight reasons why the answer might be a definitive "no". Note that it shouldn\'t directly answer the question, but bolsters the strength of the "no" position.\n4. Format your response as a JSON object containing the original question, the positive predicate, and the negative predicate.\n\nBefore providing your final output, wrap your analysis inside <analysis> tags. In your analysis:\n1. Break down the question into its key components and identify potential angles to explore.\n2. Consider the historical context and current relevance of the question.\n3. Brainstorm ideas for the positive predicate, listing at least three potential arguments.\n4. Brainstorm ideas for the negative predicate, listing at least three potential arguments.\n5. Evaluate the strength and balance of your arguments to ensure a thorough and balanced response.\n\nNote that the predicates should be usable independently and not reference each other. Eg. do NOT start the negative predicate with "However" or "On the other hand".\n\nYour final output should be formatted as follows:\n\n{\n  "question": "[Original question]",\n  "positive_predicate": "[Your generated positive predicate]",\n  "negative_predicate": "[Your generated negative predicate]"\n}\n\nMake sure to enclose the entire JSON object in curly braces {} and use double quotes for keys and string values.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\n  "question": "Is the global community adequately prepared to handle large-scale migrations compassionately?",\n  "positive_predicate": "Many countries have established robust frameworks and policies for refugee resettlement, demonstrating a commitment to humanitarian principles and a willingness to provide support for those displaced by conflict and disasters.",\n  "negative_predicate": "Despite some efforts, numerous nations still lack comprehensive policies and resources to address the complexities of large-scale migrations, leading to inadequate support systems and rising xenophobia toward migrants."\n}'}]
