The boldness of the escape highlighted systemic issues within the Indian correctional system, including overcrowding, inadequate security measures, and limited resources dedicated to rehabilitation and monitoring of inmates.

It said the air force and artillery were supporting ground forces with "precise strikes."Local residents in the Lebanese border town of Aita al-Shaab reported heavy shelling and the sound of helicopters and drones overhead.On Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant had told local council heads in northern Israel that the next phase of the war along Lebanon\'s southern border would begin soon, and would support the aim of bringing home Israelis who have fled Hezbollah rockets during nearly a year of border warfare.Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah - the most powerful leader in Tehran\'s "Axis of Resistance" against Israeli and U.S. interests in the Middle East - was killed by Israel on Friday, dealing one of the heaviest blows in decades to both Hezbollah and its backer, Iran.It followed two weeks of intensive air strikes that have eliminated several Hezbollah commanders but also killed about 1,000 civilians and forced one million to flee their homes, according to the Lebanese government.At least 95 people were killed and 172 wounded in Israeli strikes on Lebanon\'s southern regions, the eastern Bekaa Valley, and Beirut in the past 24 hours, Lebanon\'s health ministry said early on Tuesday.Hezbollah\'s deputy leader Naim Qassem, in a first public speech on Monday since Nasrallah\'s death, said that "the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement."The Israeli attacks on militant targets in Lebanon are part of a conflict stretching from the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the occupied West Bank to Iranian-backed groups in Yemen and Iraq.

The situation escalated dramatically after the reported killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, adding significant pressure on the group and its Iranian allies. Recent Israeli airstrikes have resulted in substantial casualties, claiming approximately 1,000 civilian lives and displacing a million people according to Lebanese officials. In the past day alone, Israeli strikes have reportedly killed at least 95 individuals and injured 172. Hezbollah\'s deputy leader Naim Qassem expressed readiness for ground engagement in response to the increased Israeli military actions.

Researchers have found that as rivers carve into the mountainside, they continuously remove material from the base, which in turn allows the mountain to rise. This process occurs because the erosion reduces the weight at the mountain\'s base, leading the Earth\'s crust to rebound and push the peak higher. The study highlights the dynamic interactions between geological processes and topographical features, challenging previous beliefs that external factors such as tectonic activity were solely responsible for the mountain\'s elevation. The findings suggest that active geological processes like erosion play a crucial role in shaping the natural landscape. By understanding these mechanisms, scientists can better predict how mountains like Everest may continue to evolve over time. This research not only provides insights into the dynamics of one of the world\'s tallest peaks but also emphasizes the importance of erosion in mountain formation and growth. Overall, the study reaffirms the interconnectedness of Earth\'s systems, showcasing how various forces work together to influence geological phenomena."\n}'}]

Nasrallah had built it up into Lebanon\'s most powerful military and political force, with wide sway in the Middle East.Now it faces the challenge of replacing a towering leader who was a hero to supporters because he stood up to Israel even though the West branded him a terrorist mastermind."We will choose a secretary-general for the party at the earliest opportunity...and we will fill the leadership and positions on a permanent basis," Qassem said.Qassem said Hezbollah\'s fighters had continued to fire rockets as deep as 150 km (93 miles) into Israeli territory and were ready to face any possible Israeli ground incursion."What we are doing is the bare minimum...We know that the battle may be long," he said. "We will win as we won in the liberation of 2006 in the face of the Israeli enemy," he added, referring to the last big conflict between the two foes.The possibility that Israel\'s next move might be to send ground troops and tanks over the border is on many minds and it has given no indication it will rein in the most powerful and technologically advanced military in the region.Israel says it will do what ever it takes to return its citizens to evacuated communities on its northern border safely.It has not ruled out a ground invasion and its troops have been training for it.Lebanon\'s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said on Monday his government was ready to fully implement a U.N. resolution that had aimed to end Hezbollah\'s armed presence south of the Litani River as part of an agreement to stop the war with Israel.Mikati said the Lebanese army could deploy south of the river, which lies about 30 km from the country\'s southern border.Item 1 of 10 People inspect the damage at the site of Sunday\'s Israeli attack on the city of Ain Deleb, amid the ongoing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, in southern Lebanon September 30, 2024.

Another Palestinian organisation said three of its leaders died in a strike in central Beirut - the first such hit inside the capital\'s limits.The wave of Israeli attacks on militant targets in Lebanon are part of a conflict also stretching from the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the occupied West Bank, to Yemen, and within Israel itself.Hamas said its leader in Lebanon, Fateh Sherif Abu el-Amin was killed along with his wife, son and daughter, in a strike on their house in a refugee camp in Tyre in the early hours of Monday.Another group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), said three of its leaders were killed in a strike on Beirut\'s Kola district.The attack against the PFLP was the first time Israel had struck Beirut beyond its southern suburbs. It hit the upper floor of an apartment building, Reuters witnesses said. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.MULTIPLE FRONTSThe latest actions indicated Israel has no intention of slowing down its offensive on multiple fronts even after eliminating Nasrallah, who was Iran\'s most powerful ally in its "Axis of Resistance" against Israeli and U.S. influence in the region.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said Tehran would not leave any of Israel\'s "criminal acts" go unanswered. He was referring to the killing of Nasrallah and an Iranian Guard deputy commander, Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan, who died in the same strikes on Friday.Russia said Nasrallah\'s death had led to a serious destabilisation in the broader region.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the bombing of residential areas in Lebanon had caused heavy casualties and would create a humanitarian catastrophe akin to the one in Gaza, where tens of thousands of people have died in the war between Israel and Hamas.Lebanon\'s Health Ministry says more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, without specifying how many were civilians. One million people - a fifth of the population - have fled their homes, the government says.The escalation has put Beirut on edge, with Lebanese fearful that Israel will expand its military campaign."There is nothing else to say or add, except God save Lebanon," Beirut resident Nawel said.

It introduces a system architecture for managing these agents, emphasizing the division of functions among different servers: the inference server, scaffold server, and execution server. Each server plays a crucial role in processing AI tasks and maintaining security. The article highlights the importance of clearly defining the responsibilities of each server to mitigate risks associated with misaligned AI, such as model weight exfiltration and unauthorized internal deployments. It presents operational procedures for task initiation and execution, which include user inputs, context preparation, and action execution, incorporating safety mechanisms throughout the process. The design aims to ensure that the AI operates securely and efficiently by isolating its functional components. The author warns about potential compromises, including rogue deployments or the AI modifying its environment, suggesting that standard computer security measures can help prevent these scenarios. Overall, the article serves as a foundation for understanding AI system architecture and the concurrent safety considerations necessary for developing autonomous AI agents."\n}'}]
