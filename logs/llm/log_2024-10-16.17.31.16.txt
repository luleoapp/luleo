Un\xadfor\xadtu\xadnately, pro\xadcras\xadti\xadna\xadtion and laz\xadi\xadness com\xadpound, too.</p><p>You’re stressed out for some rea\xadson, so you take the evening off for a YouTube binge. You end up stay\xading awake a lit\xadtle later than usual and sleep\xading poorly. So the next morn\xading you feel es\xadpe\xadcially tired; you snooze a few ex\xadtra times. In your rushed morn\xading rou\xadtine you don’t have time to pre\xadpare for the work meet\xading as much as you’d planned to. So you have lit\xadtle to con\xadtribute dur\xading the meet\xading. You feel bad about your perfor\xadmance. You es\xadcape from the bad feel\xadings with a Twit\xadter break. But Twit\xadter is freak\xading out. Elon Musk said <i>what?</i> Every\xadone is weigh\xading in. This is go\xading to oc\xadcupy you in\xadter\xadmit\xadtently for the rest of the day. And so on.</p><p><strong>Laz\xadi\xadness has a kind of in\xadde\xadpen\xaddent mo\xadmen\xadtum to it.</strong> When you’re hav\xading a day like the above, even if you con\xadsciously com\xadmit to get\xadting back on track, the rut tends to find its way back to you within a cou\xadple of hours. Keep this up for a few days and your sleep is ut\xadterly messed up, and you walk around in a fog. Keep it up for a week or two and you’re fully off your work\xadout rou\xadtine. In a month or two, you might have no\xadtice\xadably fallen be\xadhind on work; you might be ab\xadsent from your so\xadcial life; you might’ve visi\xadbly gained fat or lost mus\xadcle; you can no longer feel ex\xadcited about your per\xadsonal goals be\xadcause they’re be\xadhind a pile of mun\xaddane tasks you need to catch up on first. And so on.</p><p>How do we stop the vi\xadcious cir\xadcle?</p><h2><strong>I’m spiral\xading! I’m spiral\xading!</strong></h2><figure><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JBR6AF9Gusv4u6Fwo/injghkyxeeuag4xmtluq" /></figure><p><br />When you’re in a <strong>laz\xadi\xadness death spiral</strong>, it’s hard to do <i>any\xadthing</i> de\xadliber\xadate. The first and most im\xadpor\xadtant step, which does take <i>some</i> willpower but not a lot, is to ac\xadknowl\xadedge, “I’m in a laz\xadi\xadness death spiral to\xadday.”</p><p>If you don’t ac\xadknowl\xadedge it, here’s what hap\xadpens: You vaguely no\xadtice you you’ve been wast\xading time to\xadday; you feel a twinge of guilt, so you quickly de\xadcide, “I’m go\xading to turn the rest of the day around, start\xading right now.” And does that work?</p><p>Often it doesn’t! Sure, af\xadter a small lapse you can just get back on track, but if enough laz\xadi\xadness mo\xadmen\xadtum has built up, a mo\xadmen\xadtary re\xadac\xadtion doesn’t cut it. <strong>De\xadcid\xading things quickly, in re\xadsponse to nega\xadtive emo\xadtions, is ex\xadactly how you got into this situ\xada\xadtion!</strong> You’re go\xading to turn it around <i>on a whim</i>? You’ll have a differ\xadent whim in the next hour; what then? You need to take a step back and get your mind out\xadside of the prob\xadlem.</p><h2><strong>Do what you can</strong></h2><p>The next three sec\xadtions are three differ\xadent courses of ac\xadtion you can take to get out of a laz\xadi\xadness death spiral. One of them is clearly prefer\xadable, but I’m writ\xading the al\xadter\xadna\xadtives, too. When you’re in a low-willpower state, it’s of\xadten bad to at\xadtempt the <i>very best solu\xadtion</i>—the farther you reach, the harder you can fall. Build\xading a base of “small wins” is the re\xadli\xadable way to re\xadpair your willpower. If you start some\xadthing lofty and then bail on it, you’re do\xading real dam\xadage: log\xadging an\xadother willpower failure and as\xadso\xadci\xadat\xading that “very best solu\xadtion” with failure.</p><p>Here are the moves:</p><h2><strong>A) Emer\xadgency recovery</strong></h2><p>If you’re in a laz\xadi\xadness spiral and you <i>need</i> to get out of it <i>right now</i>, there are some mea\xadsures you can take that, while effec\xadtive, are not ideal. They are un\xadsus\xadtain\xadable, pro\xadmote bad habits, or are just gen\xader\xadally un\xadhealthy. But some\xadtimes the need is there: maybe you have a dead\xadline fast ap\xadproach\xading (and the dead\xadline it\xadself isn’t enough to snap you into ac\xadtion); maybe your friends or fam\xadily need you to take care of some\xadthing <i>to\xadday</i>; maybe you were in the mid\xaddle of an awfully lazy day and a once-in-a-life\xadtime op\xadpor\xadtu\xadnity came up, and you just can’t fo\xadcus enough to act on it.</p><p>Dis\xadclaimer: I be\xadlieve that <strong>in a well planned life, none of these should ever be nec\xades\xadsary</strong>. I’m only writ\xading them be\xadcause we are not perfect.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Mo\xadti\xadva\xadtional videos</strong>: It’s a whole genre of YouTube/\u200bIn\xadsta\xadgram con\xadtent. They make tons of this stuff. The male-coded ones have clips of men lift\xading weights and climb\xading moun\xadtains set to au\xaddio of David Gog\xadgins or CT Fletcher yel\xadling at you to get to work. The fe\xadmale-coded ones, I’m led to be\xadlieve, fea\xadture beau\xadtiful and con\xadfi\xaddent women giv\xading pos\xadi\xadtive af\xadfir\xadma\xadtions. Th\xadese videos do work; they in\xadspire a cer\xadtain emo\xadtional state in their tar\xadget au\xaddi\xadence, and that state pro\xadvides the men\xadtal en\xadergy to take im\xadme\xaddi\xadate ac\xadtion. The down\xadside is that you nat\xadu\xadrally build up a tol\xader\xadance to emo\xadtional trig\xadgers over time; you can’t watch the same video ev\xadery day be\xadfore your work\xadout and ex\xadpect it to feel the same. The other down\xadside is that they might not even last very long. Your emo\xadtional state <i>will</i> change again, maybe sooner than you think.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mu\xadsic</strong>: Listen to the songs that you as\xadso\xadci\xadate with ac\xadtion. Similarly, this in\xadspires an emo\xadtional state. I find that here, too, the effect is short-lived, un\xadless I keep the playlist go\xading (and some\xadtimes you <i>can’t</i> have mu\xadsic play\xading while fo\xadcus\xading on the work you need to do).</p></li><li><p><strong>Drugs</strong>: Ingest enough caf\xadfeine to change your headspace. Or take Ad\xadder\xadall or some var\xadi\xadant. Don’t listen to me, I don’t know any\xadthing about drugs. Ob\xadvi\xadously you’ll build up a tol\xader\xadance over time and ob\xadvi\xadously it’s very bad to de\xadpend on a sub\xadstance to perform.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>B) Nat\xadu\xadral recovery</strong></h2><p>What’s the eas\xadiest way to get out of a spiral, with\xadout do\xading any\xadthing dras\xadtic or un\xadusual? I find there are times when it’s nat\xadu\xadrally eas\xadier to change course. And if you wait for them to come, you can pull your\xadself out of a spiral with\xadout a her\xadculean effort of willpower. Then you can an\xada\xadlyze what went wrong and avoid those cir\xadcum\xadstances in the fu\xadture.</p><h3><strong>Wait for a re\xadset point</strong></h3><p>For me, wak\xading up in the morn\xading is a men\xadtal re\xadset; noth\xading from my headspace the night be\xadfore re\xadally makes it to the morn\xading. Now, bad habits from the night be\xadfore might’ve given me less sleep, or poor sleep, but I find that my willpower is usu\xadally fresh. So when I’m hav\xading an off day, and I no\xadtice, I might just call the rest of the day a wash and start plan\xadning what I’m go\xading to do to\xadmor\xadrow. Even as I’m caught up in lazy ac\xadtivity, I’m mak\xading spe\xadcific plans to be pro\xadduc\xadtive to\xadmor\xadrow. The fact that it’s at a later point in time means I’m think\xading about it for a while, putting more men\xadtal en\xadergy into the plan. That’s the op\xadpo\xadsite of “de\xadcid\xading on a whim.”</p><p>It also gives me time to re\xadal\xadize, wow, I re\xadally don’t en\xadjoy be\xading lazy. In my <a href="https://patrickdfarley.com/new-years-resolutions/">New-Year’s re\xads\xadolu\xadtion rant</a> I talked about this effect. For those who con\xadtinu\xadally fail their New Year’s re\xads\xadolu\xadtions:</p><blockquote><p><i>Got a pro\xadject you’ve been ex\xadcited about but afraid to start? Don’t even think about it—don’t en\xadjoy the fan\xadtasy of it; stop tel\xadling your friends about it; pre\xadtend you never had that in\xadten\xadtion in the first place.</i></p><p><i>In other words, <strong>ag\xadgres\xadsively run away from your goals, and re\xadflect on how mis\xader\xadable it is to live that way</strong>. The re\xadflec\xadtion is cru\xadcial: if you’re self-for\xadget\xadful /\u200b not mind\xadful about it, you’ll risk stay\xading in that state. Do it for a week or two, re\xadflect on how much it sucks, and in do\xading so you’ll con\xaddi\xadtion your mind to view the goal as a valuable op\xadpor\xadtu\xadnity to es\xadcape that mis\xadery (which it is).</i></p></blockquote><p>Some\xadtimes you cog\xadni\xadtively “want” some\xadthing, but there’s just no men\xadtal en\xadergy be\xadhind that want. You know some goal or idea is good for you, but you don’t <i>feel</i>, sub\xadcon\xadsciously and emo\xadtion\xadally, that it’s good for you. Some\xadtimes you need to feel it. So, you should go com\xadpletely with\xadout the thing for a while, and al\xadlow your\xadself to feel ir\xadri\xadtated by that con\xaddi\xadtion.</p><p>This is ac\xadtu\xadally a sneaky form of self-con\xadtrol. <strong>When you no\xadtice you’ve been lazy, your </strong><i><strong>next im\xadpulse</strong></i><strong> is to dash into some “pro\xadduc\xadtive” task to start “mak\xading up for” the lost time. But this re\xadin\xadforces a habit of act\xading on im\xadpulses.</strong> In a way, it’s more difficult to re\xadmain in the state you’re in and ac\xadcept the loss. A per\xadson who can do that can also wake up the next day and be ex\xadtremely pro\xadduc\xadtive.</p><p>What are your nat\xadu\xadral re\xadset points? Maybe it’s the morn\xading. Maybe it’s when you go to a spe\xadcific lo\xadca\xadtion. Maybe it’s a spe\xadcific day of the week. Iden\xadtify your next re\xadset point, and then wait pa\xadtiently for it to come.</p><h3><strong>An\xada\xadlyze the cir\xadcum\xadstances that caused it</strong></h3><p>The other part of the nat\xadu\xadral re\xadcov\xadery is to no\xadtice what started your spiral, so you can avoid it in the fu\xadture. You do this anal\xady\xadsis as soon as you’re at a re\xadset point. Look at your re\xadcent ac\xadtivity and ask, “Where did I go off the rails ear\xadlier?”</p><blockquote><p><i>af\xadter a chess game, i open the game re\xadview, won\xadder\xading: which move lost me the game? was i win\xadning at any point?</i></p><p><i>i need life game re\xadview at the end of ev\xadery day. when did my day go awry? was i on pace to have a pro\xadduc\xadtive day at any point?</i></p><p><i>— monk (@me\xadchan\xadi\xadcal_monk) </i><a href="https://twitter.com/mechanical_monk/status/1689631570217537536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"><i>Au\xadgust 10, 2023</i></a></p></blockquote><p>In do\xading that re\xadview, you’ll dis\xadcover how far back the laz\xadi\xadness death spiral goes. “Well it’s cause I got up late to\xadday. Why was I on my phone so late last night? Oh yeah, that other thing…”</p><p>For me, when I get down to the real origi\xadnal cause, it’s of\xadten some\xadthing <i>very</i> mun\xaddane that just hap\xadpened to oc\xadcur at the perfect mo\xadment to throw me off. A few ex\xadam\xadples:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Food</strong>: I ate a huge meal and it put me into a food coma that I wasn’t pre\xadpared for.</p></li><li><p><strong>Me\xaddia</strong>: I watched some\xadthing a lit\xadtle too at\xadten\xadtion-grabby, a lit\xadtle too early in the day. On the spec\xadtrum from art to en\xadter\xadtain\xadment—where the art re\xadquires more men\xadtal en\xadergy to en\xadjoy but de\xadliv\xaders richer value, and en\xadter\xadtain\xadment can be en\xadjoyed pas\xadsively but is cheap value—I mostly only slide to\xadward the en\xadter\xadtain\xadment side through\xadout the day. So for ex\xadam\xadple if I play a video game at 6pm, there’s very lit\xadtle chance I’m go\xading to be con\xadsum\xading some\xadthing thought\xadful and com\xadplex at 9pm.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sleep</strong>: This is ac\xadtu\xadally more nu\xadanced than just “I didn’t get enough”: wak\xading up at the wrong point in your sleep cy\xadcle makes you feel much grog\xadgier. In any case, if I wake up feel\xading off and I don’t im\xadme\xaddi\xadately need to be some\xadwhere, I’ll drag it out, snooz\xading. And that doesn’t make the grog\xadgi\xadness go away. And al\xadthough I may not miss any ex\xadplicit plans, it puts me on a lazy bent.</p></li><li><p><strong>De\xadci\xadsion spirals</strong>: I don’t nec\xades\xadsar\xadily be\xadlieve in <i>de\xadci\xadsion fa\xadtigue</i>, but there’s a cer\xadtain kind of de\xadci\xadsion that’s ab\xadsolutely dev\xadas\xadtat\xading for my pro\xadduc\xadtivity. It’s when I have to pick be\xadtween two pretty bal\xadanced choices, but there are many lit\xadtle de\xadtails to con\xadsider on each side. The longer you spend think\xading about it, the more dy\xadnam\xadics re\xadveal them\xadselves. So it’s kind ad\xaddict\xading; you hope that if you just view the prob\xadlem from one more an\xadgle, some\xadthing stark will ap\xadpear and make the choice easy. But the more time you spend, the more cost you have sunk into it, which makes it feel all the more im\xadpor\xadtant that you de\xadcide op\xadti\xadmally when you fi\xadnally de\xadcide! In short, <a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/i/44314254/choice-hijacks-you-into-choosing-mode">Choices are bad</a>. </p></li></ul><p>So, that’s the nat\xadu\xadral re\xadcov\xadery. It works pretty well, but the down\xadside is that you can get knocked off again. You might know the ex\xadact cir\xadcum\xadstan\xadtial trig\xadgers that caused a spiral last time, but differ\xadent ones will come up next time. Some you can miti\xadgate, but some will keep com\xading at you be\xadcause, as I said, they’re mun\xaddane. And that makes me again won\xadder how some\xadthing as or\xaddi\xadnary as a big meal had such a great effect on my day—per\xadhaps some\xadthing else is go\xading on.</p><h2><strong>C) Heroic recovery</strong></h2><p>The heroic re\xadcov\xadery from a laz\xadi\xadness spiral is harder and takes longer to work, but it solves the prob\xadlem in a more com\xadplete way. I have enough fa\xadmil\xadiar\xadity with this to see how it works, but not a ton of fa\xadmil\xadiar\xadity. I learn from peo\xadple more ma\xadture than me; ev\xadery day is a jour\xadney.</p><p>In short, <strong>the heroic re\xadcov\xadery means deeply an\xada\xadlyz\xading your\xadself to un\xadder\xadstand the root cause of your es\xadcapes to lazy pas\xadtimes</strong>—your de\xadci\xadsions to <i>dis\xadso\xadci\xadate</i> from what’s go\xading on im\xadme\xaddi\xadately in front of you.</p><h3><strong>Deep psych work</strong></h3><p>Think about the cir\xadcum\xadstances be\xadhind your lapse, like you did in the last sec\xadtion. Then go deeper and an\xada\xadlyze ex\xadactly why you re\xadsponded the way you did.

I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I\'ve since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).\nIt\'s a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it\'s worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you\'re listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?\n"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR\'s Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he\'s performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.\n"A lot of us aren\'t great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.\nBut of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.\nFigure out what you\'re trying to accomplish\nLike speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?\nPlaylists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you\'re going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.\nSponsor Message\nThis is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!\nPick the songs\nOnce you\'ve got your mood in mind, now it\'s time to pick the songs. Don\'t be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you\'re going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It\'s fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they\'ll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).\nBobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you\'re not a professional DJ, he says there\'s no shame in cheating.\n"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.\nCrib from other peoples\' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it\'s all fair game.\nStructure the playlist like a flight\nGenerally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That\'s the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it\'s a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.\nFor instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye\'s "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It\'s nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He\'ll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.\nObviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.\nThis is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It\'s set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I\'m going for.\nSurprise!\nOne of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.\nOf course, "new" doesn\'t have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.\n\n\n</article>\n\nNext, you will be provided with two pieces of information:\n\n1.

I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I\'ve since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).\nIt\'s a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it\'s worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you\'re listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?\n"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR\'s Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he\'s performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.\n"A lot of us aren\'t great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.\nBut of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.\nFigure out what you\'re trying to accomplish\nLike speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?\nPlaylists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you\'re going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.\nSponsor Message\nThis is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!\nPick the songs\nOnce you\'ve got your mood in mind, now it\'s time to pick the songs. Don\'t be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you\'re going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It\'s fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they\'ll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).\nBobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you\'re not a professional DJ, he says there\'s no shame in cheating.\n"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.\nCrib from other peoples\' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it\'s all fair game.\nStructure the playlist like a flight\nGenerally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That\'s the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it\'s a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.\nFor instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye\'s "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It\'s nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He\'ll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.\nObviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.\nThis is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It\'s set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I\'m going for.\nSurprise!\nOne of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.\nOf course, "new" doesn\'t have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.\n\n\n</article>\n\nNext, you will be provided with two pieces of information:\n\n1.
