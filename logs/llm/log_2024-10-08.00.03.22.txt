The humanitarian crisis has significantly deepened, with countless lives affected and regional stability crumbling. The rise of militant groups and external influences exacerbates the volatile environment, raising concerns about broader implications for neighboring countries. Political landscapes are shifting, and diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation appear to falter as mistrust and aggression dominate interactions. As violence escalates, civilians continue to bear the brunt of the conflict, facing severe shortages of resources and safety. The international community is called upon to reassess its approach, as traditional methods of conflict resolution seem ineffective.

He’s in a white room, with a de\xadvice con\xadnected through\xadout his ner\xadvous sys\xadtem, in\xadflict\xading max\xadi\xadmum white-hot agony. When\xadever the suffer\xading be\xadcomes so great that his body tunes it out, it gives him just enough time to re\xadlax to hurt all the more when it abruptly starts up again. </p><p>Every day, an alien woman comes to visit him. She talks to him, dur\xading lulls in the tor\xadture, about philos\xado\xadphy and life and his\xadtory. She asks him what he thinks about things. He says “I think I’m be\xading fuck\xading tor\xadtured. Can you please help?”, and she kind of ig\xadnores him and goes on talk\xading about philos\xado\xadphy and life and his\xadtory and stuff. Some\xadtimes he tries more clever ways to pry in\xadfor\xadma\xadtion out of her, to no avail.</p><p>After sev\xaderal weeks (or months?) of this, at some point he asks again “Se\xadri\xadously what the hell? Who are you? What is hap\xadpen\xading to me? Why are you tor\xadtur\xading me, or, not helping? What is go\xading on?”</p><p>She says: “Do you know what a shad\xadow\xadmoth is?”</p><p>“An\xadswer my fuck\xading ques\xadtion”</p><p>“Do you know what a shad\xadow\xadmoth is?”</p><p>“Fine, a shad\xadow\xadmoth is a life form na\xadtive to Cor\xadus\xadcant. They’re sili\xadcon-based, their wingflutes make mu\xadsic once they leave the co\xadcoon and can fly.”</p><p>She nods, and says “Once, I saw a shad\xadow\xadmoth in its co\xadcoon, strug\xadgling. Like you, I am sen\xadsi\xadtive to the force – I didn’t merely em\xadpathize with it, but I felt it. When shad\xadow\xadmoths strive to break free from their co\xadcoon, they are in pain. I felt it’s pain. And I felt it’s envy of the other moths, already free, fly\xading, mak\xading mu\xadsic. I wanted to help it.”</p><p>Ja\xadcen shud\xadders. “Oh no, you didn’t –”</p><p>“Yes. I cut it free.”</p><p>“No –”</p><p>“It sounds like you know what hap\xadpened next?”</p><p>Ja\xadcen says: “If they don’t es\xadcape from the co\xadcoon on their own, they’ll never be strong enough to fly, and they suffer and starve to death, worse than what they were ex\xadpe\xadrienc\xading in the co\xadcoon.”</p><p>“In\xaddeed.”<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefm4kuzcus6g9"><sup><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/index?view=featured&amp;format=rss#fnm4kuzcus6g9">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>The two of them sit for awhile. The tor\xadture ma\xadchine gives Ja\xadcen an\xadother wave of White Pain. Then the woman says “Sup\xadpose you did want to help a shad\xadow\xadmoth. What would you do, if you couldn’t cut it free? You might sit with it, and let it know that it’s not alone, and that it’s pain is in the ser\xadvice of it’s des\xadtiny.”</p><p>And then she leaves for the day.</p><p>And, then, it oc\xadcurs to Ja\xadcen:</p><p>It’s been months. They haven’t asked him any ques\xadtions. There is no in\xaddi\xadca\xadtion that they par\xadtic\xadu\xadlarly want any\xadthing from him. There is no in\xaddi\xadca\xadtion that the White Hot Tor\xadture will ever stop.</p><p>What would he do, if this was liter\xadally the only thing there would ever be?

He con\xadverses freely with the woman about philos\xado\xadphy and his\xadtory and life and stuff.</p><p>And, then, his cap\xadtors say “Con\xadgrat\xadu\xadla\xadtions.

She compares his struggle to a shadowmoth trapped in a cocoon, highlighting that while the struggle is painful, it is a necessary part of growth. The alien woman\'s eventual realization is that directly helping the moth can prevent it from developing the strength needed to thrive. This leads to Jacen understanding that he must adapt his relationship with his torture and learn to accept it, which eventually results in a form of enlightenment. The article touches upon the balance between accepting suffering as a learning process and the ethical implications of causing pain for growth. It emphasizes the importance of self-agency, resilience, and understanding one\'s internal locus of control, while acknowledging that sometimes outside help is necessary. Ultimately, the narrative suggests a blend of tough personal growth experiences with empathy towards oneself, reinforcing that achieving true independence and self-acceptance is essential even in times of struggle."\n}'}]
