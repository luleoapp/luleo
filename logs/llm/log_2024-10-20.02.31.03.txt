A fol\xadlow-up post will spec\xadu\xadlate about how to for\xadmal\xadize an al\xadter\xadna\xadtive.</p><h3><strong>De\xadgrees of belief</strong></h3><p>The core idea of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/">Bayesian episte\xadmol\xadogy</a>: we should ideally rea\xadson by as\xadsign\xading cre\xaddences to propo\xadsi\xadtions which rep\xadre\xadsent our de\xadgrees of be\xadlief that those propo\xadsi\xadtions are true. (Note that this is differ\xadent from Bayesi\xadanism as a set of statis\xadti\xadcal tech\xadniques, or Bayesi\xadanism as an ap\xadproach to ma\xadchine learn\xading, which I don’t dis\xadcuss here.)</p><p>If that seems like a suffi\xadcient char\xadac\xadter\xadi\xadza\xadtion to you, you can go ahead and skip to the next sec\xadtion, where I ex\xadplain my ob\xadjec\xadtions to it. But for those who want a more pre\xadcise de\xadscrip\xadtion of Bayesi\xadanism, and some ex\xadist\xading ob\xadjec\xadtions to it, I’ll more speci\xadfi\xadcally char\xadac\xadter\xadize it in terms of five sub\xadclaims. Bayesi\xadanism says that we should ideally rea\xadson in terms of:</p><ol><li><p>Propo\xadsi\xadtions which are ei\xadther true or false (<strong>clas\xadsi\xadcal logic</strong>)</p></li><li><p>Each of which is as\xadsigned a cre\xaddence (<strong>prob\xada\xadbil\xadism</strong>)</p></li><li><p>Rep\xadre\xadsent\xading sub\xadjec\xadtive de\xadgrees of be\xadlief in their truth (<strong>sub\xadjec\xadtivism</strong>)</p></li><li><p>Which at each point in time obey the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms">ax\xadioms of prob\xada\xadbil\xadity</a> (<strong>static ra\xadtio\xadnal\xadity</strong>)</p></li><li><p>And are up\xaddated over time by ap\xadply\xading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes’ rule</a> to new ev\xadi\xaddence (<strong>rigid em\xadpiri\xadcism</strong>)</p></li></ol><p>I won’t go into the case <i>for</i> Bayesi\xadanism here ex\xadcept to say that it does el\xade\xadgantly for\xadmal\xadize many com\xadmon-sense in\xadtu\xaditions. Bayes’ rule fol\xadlows di\xadrectly from <a href="https://oscarbonilla.com/2009/05/visualizing-bayes-theorem/">a straight\xadfor\xadward Venn di\xada\xadgram</a>. The ax\xadioms of prob\xada\xadbil\xadity are pow\xader\xadful and math\xade\xadmat\xadi\xadcally satis\xadfy\xading. Sub\xadjec\xadtive cre\xaddences seem like the ob\xadvi\xadous way to rep\xadre\xadsent our un\xadcer\xadtainty about the world. Nev\xader\xadthe\xadless, there are a wide range of al\xadter\xadna\xadtives to Bayesi\xadanism, each branch\xading off from the claims listed above at differ\xadent points:</p><ol><li><p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-analysis/"><i>Tra\xaddi\xadtional episte\xadmol\xadogy</i></a> only ac\xadcepts #1, and re\xadjects #2. Tra\xaddi\xadtional episte\xadmol\xado\xadgists of\xadten defend a bi\xadnary con\xadcep\xadtion of knowl\xadedge—e.g. one defined in terms of jus\xadtified true be\xadlief (or a similar crite\xadrion, like re\xadli\xadable be\xadlief).</p></li><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability"><i>Fre\xadquen\xadtism</i></a><i> </i>ac\xadcepts #1 and #2, but re\xadjects #3: it doesn’t think that cre\xaddences should be sub\xadjec\xadtive. In\xadstead, fre\xadquen\xadtism holds that cre\xaddences should cor\xadre\xadspond to the rel\xada\xadtive fre\xadquency of an event in the long term, which is an ob\xadjec\xadtive fact about the world. For ex\xadam\xadple, you should as\xadsign 50% cre\xaddence that a flipped coin will come up heads, be\xadcause if you con\xadtinued flip\xadping the coin the pro\xadpor\xadtion of heads would ap\xadproach 50%.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/y5GftLezdozEHdXkL/an-intuitive-guide-to-garrabrant-induction"><i>Garrabrant in\xadduc\xadtion</i></a> ac\xadcepts #1 to #3, but re\xadjects #4. In or\xadder for cre\xaddences to obey the ax\xadioms of prob\xada\xadbil\xadity, all the log\xadi\xadcal im\xadpli\xadca\xadtions of a state\xadment must be as\xadsigned the same cre\xaddence. But this “log\xadi\xadcal om\xadni\xadscience” is im\xadpos\xadsi\xadble for com\xadpu\xadta\xadtion\xadally-bounded agents like our\xadselves. So in the Garrabrant in\xadduc\xadtion frame\xadwork, cre\xaddences in\xadstead con\xadverge to obey\xading the ax\xadioms of prob\xada\xadbil\xadity in the limit, with\xadout guaran\xadtees that they’re co\xadher\xadent af\xadter only limited think\xading time.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/xJyY5QkQvNJpZLJRo/radical-probabilism-1"><i>Rad\xadi\xadcal prob\xada\xadbil\xadism</i></a> ac\xadcepts #1 to #4, but re\xadjects #5. Again, this can be mo\xadti\xadvated by qualms about log\xadi\xadcal om\xadni\xadscience: if think\xading for longer can iden\xadtify new im\xadpli\xadca\xadtions of our ex\xadist\xading be\xadliefs, then our cre\xaddences some\xadtimes need to up\xaddate via a differ\xadent mechanism than Bayes’ rule. So rad\xadi\xadcal prob\xada\xadbil\xadism in\xadstead al\xadlows an agent to up\xaddate to any set of stat\xadi\xadcally ra\xadtio\xadnal cre\xaddences at any time, even if they’re to\xadtally differ\xadent from its pre\xadvi\xadous cre\xaddences. The one con\xadstraint is that each cre\xaddence needs to con\xadverge over time to a fixed value—i.e. it can’t con\xadtinue os\xadcillat\xading in\xaddefinitely (oth\xader\xadwise the agent would be vuln\xader\xada\xadble to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_book_theorems">Dutch Book</a>).</p></li></ol><p>It’s not cru\xadcial whether we clas\xadsify Garrabrant in\xadduc\xadtion and rad\xadi\xadcal prob\xada\xadbil\xadism as var\xadi\xadants of Bayesi\xadanism or al\xadter\xadna\xadtives to it, be\xadcause my main ob\xadjec\xadtion to Bayesi\xadanism doesn’t fall into any of the above cat\xade\xadgories. In\xadstead, I think we need to go back to ba\xadsics and re\xadject #1. Speci\xadfi\xadcally, I have two ob\xadjec\xadtions to the idea that ideal\xadized rea\xadson\xading should be un\xadder\xadstood in terms of propo\xadsi\xadtions that are true or false:</p><ol><li><p>We should as\xadsign truth-val\xadues that are in\xadter\xadme\xaddi\xadate be\xadtween true and false (<strong>fuzzy truth-val\xadues</strong>)</p></li><li><p>We should rea\xadson in terms of <i>mod\xadels</i> rather than propo\xadsi\xadtions (the <strong>se\xadman\xadtic view</strong>)</p></li></ol><p>I’ll defend each claim in turn.</p><h3><strong>De\xadgrees of truth</strong></h3><p>For\xadmal lan\xadguages (like code) are only able to ex\xadpress ideas that can be pinned down pre\xadcisely. Nat\xadu\xadral lan\xadguages, by con\xadtrast, can re\xadfer to vague con\xadcepts which don’t have clear, fixed bound\xadaries. For ex\xadam\xadple, the truth-val\xadues of propo\xadsi\xadtions which con\xadtain <a href="https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/grammar/b1-b2-grammar/adjectives-gradable-non-gradable">grad\xadable ad\xadjec\xadtives</a> like “large” or “quiet” or “happy” de\xadpend on how we in\xadter\xadpret those ad\xadjec\xadtives. In\xadtu\xaditively speak\xading, a de\xadscrip\xadtion of some\xadthing as “large” can be more or less true de\xadpend\xading on how large it ac\xadtu\xadally is. The most com\xadmon way to for\xadmu\xadlate this spec\xadtrum is as “fuzzy” truth-val\xadues which range from 0 to 1. A value close to 1 would be as\xadsigned to claims that are clearly true, and a value close to 0 would be as\xadsigned to claims that are clearly false, with claims that are “kinda true” in the mid\xaddle.</p><p>Another type of “kinda true” state\xadments are ap\xadprox\xadi\xadma\xadtions. For ex\xadam\xadple, if I claim that there’s a gro\xadcery store 500 me\xadters away from my house, that’s prob\xada\xadbly true in an <i>ap\xadprox\xadi\xadmate</i> sense, but false in a <i>pre\xadcise</i> sense. But once we start dis\xadt\xadin\xadguish\xading the differ\xadent senses that a con\xadcept can have, it be\xadcomes clear that ba\xadsi\xadcally <i>any</i> con\xadcept can have widely di\xadver\xadgent cat\xade\xadgory bound\xadaries de\xadpend\xading on the con\xadtext. <a href="https://metarationality.com/refrigerator">A strik\xading ex\xadam\xadple from Chap\xadman</a>: </p><blockquote><p>A: Is there any wa\xadter in the re\xadfriger\xada\xadtor?<br />B: Yes.<br />A: Where? I don’t see it.<br />B: In the cells of the egg\xadplant.</p></blockquote><p>The claim that there’s wa\xadter in the re\xadfriger\xada\xadtor is tech\xadni\xadcally true, but prag\xadmat\xadi\xadcally false. And the con\xadcept of “wa\xadter” is far bet\xadter-defined than al\xadmost all ab\xadstract con\xadcepts (like the ones I’m us\xading in this post). So we should treat nat\xadu\xadral-lan\xadguage propo\xadsi\xadtions as con\xadtext-de\xadpen\xaddent by de\xadfault. But that’s still con\xadsis\xadtent with some state\xadments be\xading <i>more</i> con\xadtext-de\xadpen\xaddent than oth\xaders (e.g. the claim that there’s air in my re\xadfriger\xada\xadtor would be true un\xadder al\xadmost any in\xadter\xadpre\xadta\xadtion). So an\xadother way we can think about fuzzy truth-val\xadues is as a range from “this state\xadment is false in al\xadmost any sense” through “this state\xadment is true in some senses and false in some senses” to “this state\xadment is true in al\xadmost any sense”.</p><p>Note, how\xadever, that there’s an asym\xadme\xadtry be\xadtween “this state\xadment is true in al\xadmost any sense” and “this state\xadment is false in al\xadmost any sense”, be\xadcause the lat\xadter can ap\xadply to two differ\xadent types of claims. Firstly, claims that are mean\xadingful but false (“there’s a tiger in my house”). Se\xadcondly, claims that are <i>non\xadsense</i>—there are just no mean\xadingful in\xadter\xadpre\xadta\xadtions of them at all (“col\xador\xadless green ideas sleep fu\xadri\xadously”). We can of\xadten dis\xadt\xadin\xadguish these two types of claims by negat\xading them: “there isn’t a tiger in my house” is true, whereas “col\xador\xadless green ideas don’t sleep fu\xadri\xadously” is still non\xadsense. Of course, non\xadsense is also a mat\xadter of de\xadgree—e.g. metaphors are by de\xadfault less mean\xadingful than con\xadcrete claims, but still not en\xadtirely non\xadsense.</p><p>So I’ve mo\xadti\xadvated fuzzy truth-val\xadues from four differ\xadent an\xadgles: vague\xadness, ap\xadprox\xadi\xadma\xadtion, con\xadtext-de\xadpen\xaddence, and sense vs non\xadsense. The key idea be\xadhind each of them is that con\xadcepts have fluid and amor\xadphous cat\xade\xadgory bound\xadaries (a prop\xaderty called <a href="https://metarationality.com/nebulosity"><i>neb\xadu\xadlos\xadity</i></a>). How\xadever, putting all of these differ\xadent as\xadpects of neb\xadu\xadlos\xadity on the same zero-to-one scale might be an over\xadsim\xadplifi\xadca\xadtion. More gen\xader\xadally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">fuzzy logic</a> has few of the ap\xadpeal\xading prop\xader\xadties of clas\xadsi\xadcal logic, and (to my knowl\xadedge) isn’t very di\xadrectly use\xadful. So I’m not claiming that we should adopt fuzzy logic whole\xadsale, or that we know what it means for a given propo\xadsi\xadtion to be X% true in\xadstead of Y% true (a ques\xadtion which I’ll come back to in a fol\xadlow-up post). For now, I’m just claiming that there’s an im\xadpor\xadtant sense in which think\xading in terms of fuzzy truth-val\xadues is <i>less wrong</i> (an\xadother non-bi\xadnary truth-value) than only think\xading in terms of bi\xadnary truth-val\xadues.</p><h3><strong>Model-based reasoning</strong></h3><p>The in\xadtu\xaditions in fa\xadvor of fuzzy truth-val\xadues be\xadcome clearer when we ap\xadply them, not just to in\xaddi\xadvi\xadd\xadual propo\xadsi\xadtions, but to <i>mod\xadels</i> of the world. By a model I mean a (math\xade\xadmat\xadi\xadcal) struc\xadture that at\xadtempts to de\xadscribe some as\xadpect of re\xadal\xadity. For ex\xadam\xadple, a model of the weather might have vari\xadables rep\xadre\xadsent\xading tem\xadper\xada\xadture, pres\xadsure, and hu\xadmidity at differ\xadent lo\xadca\xadtions, and a pro\xadce\xaddure for up\xaddat\xading them over time. A model of a chem\xadi\xadcal re\xadac\xadtion might have vari\xadables rep\xadre\xadsent\xading the start\xading con\xadcen\xadtra\xadtions of differ\xadent re\xadac\xadtants, and a method for de\xadter\xadmin\xading the equil\xadibrium con\xadcen\xadtra\xadtions. Or, more sim\xadply, a model of the Earth might just be a sphere.</p><p>In or\xadder to pin down the differ\xadence be\xadtween rea\xadson\xading about propo\xadsi\xadtions and rea\xadson\xading about mod\xadels, philoso\xadphers of sci\xadence have drawn on con\xadcepts from math\xade\xadmat\xadi\xadcal logic. They dis\xadt\xadin\xadguish be\xadtween the <i>syn\xadtac\xadtic</i> con\xadtent of a the\xadory (the ax\xadioms of the the\xadory) and its <i>se\xadman\xadtic</i> con\xadtent (the mod\xadels for which those ax\xadioms hold). <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structure-scientific-theories/">As an ex\xadam\xadple</a>, con\xadsider the three ax\xadioms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane">pro\xadjec\xadtive planes</a>:</p><ol><li><p>For any two points, ex\xadactly one line lies on both.</p></li><li><p>For any two lines, ex\xadactly one point lies on both.</p></li><li><p>There ex\xadists a set of four points such that no line has more than two of them.</p></li></ol><p>There are in\xadfinitely many mod\xadels for which these ax\xadioms hold; here’s one of the sim\xadplest:</p><p class="imgonly"><img alt="Geometric figure including triangle ACE with interior circle BDF and center point G.

For ex\xadam\xadple, a neu\xadral net\xadwork might en\xadcode a great deal of real-world knowl\xadedge, but even full ac\xadcess to the weights doesn’t al\xadlow us to ex\xadtract that knowl\xadedge di\xadrectly—the fact that a given weight is 0.3 doesn’t al\xadlow us to claim that any real-world en\xadtity has the value 0.3.</p><p>What about sci\xaden\xadtific mod\xadels where each el\xade\xadment of the model <i>is</i> in\xadtended to cor\xadre\xadspond to an as\xadpect of re\xadal\xadity? For ex\xadam\xadple, what’s the differ\xadence be\xadtween mod\xadel\xading the Earth as a sphere, and just be\xadliev\xading the propo\xadsi\xadtion “the Earth is a sphere”? My an\xadswer: think\xading in terms of propo\xadsi\xadtions (known in philos\xado\xadphy of sci\xadence as the <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/Suppe_2000.pdf"><i>syn\xadtac\xadtic view</i></a>) bi\xadases us to\xadwards as\xadsign\xading truth val\xadues in a <i>re\xadduc\xadtion\xadist</i> way. This works when you’re us\xading bi\xadnary truth-val\xadues, be\xadcause they re\xadlate to each other ac\xadcord\xading to clas\xadsi\xadcal logic. But when you’re us\xading fuzzy truth-val\xadues, the re\xadla\xadtion\xadships be\xadtween the truth-val\xadues of differ\xadent propo\xadsi\xadtions be\xadcome much more com\xadpli\xadcated. And so think\xading in terms of mod\xadels (known as the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/187834"><i>se\xadman\xadtic view</i></a>) is bet\xadter be\xadcause mod\xadels can be as\xadsigned truth-val\xadues in a <i>holis\xadtic </i>way.</p><p>As an ex\xadam\xadple: “the Earth is a sphere” is mostly true, and “ev\xadery point on the sur\xadface of a sphere is equally far away from its cen\xadter” is pre\xadcisely true. But “ev\xadery point on the sur\xadface of the Earth is equally far away from the Earth’s cen\xadter” seems ridicu\xadlous—e.g. it im\xadplies that moun\xadtains don’t ex\xadist. The prob\xadlem here is that rephras\xading a propo\xadsi\xadtion in log\xadi\xadcally equiv\xada\xadlent terms can dra\xadmat\xadi\xadcally af\xadfect its im\xadplicit con\xadtext, and there\xadfore the de\xadgree of truth we as\xadsign to it in iso\xadla\xadtion.</p><p>The se\xadman\xadtic view solves this by sep\xada\xadrat\xading claims about the struc\xadture of the model it\xadself from claims about how the model re\xadlates to the world. The former are typ\xadi\xadcally much less neb\xadu\xadlous—claims like “in the spher\xadi\xadcal model of the Earth, ev\xadery point on the Earth’s sur\xadface is equally far away from the cen\xadter” are straight\xadfor\xadwardly true. But we can then bring in neb\xadu\xadlos\xadity when talk\xading about the model as a whole—e.g. “my spher\xadi\xadcal model of the Earth is closer to the truth than your flat model of the Earth”, or “my spher\xadi\xadcal model of the Earth is use\xadful for do\xading as\xadtro\xadnom\xadi\xadcal calcu\xadla\xadtions and ter\xadrible for figur\xading out where to go skiing”. (Note that we can make similar claims about the men\xadtal mod\xadels, neu\xadral net\xadworks, etc, dis\xadcussed above.)</p><p>We might then won\xadder: should we be talk\xading about the truth of en\xadtire mod\xadels at all? Or can we just talk about their use\xadful\xadness in differ\xadent con\xadtexts, with\xadout the con\xadcept of truth? This is <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/"><i>the</i> ma\xadjor de\xadbate in philos\xado\xadphy of sci\xadence</a>. I per\xadson\xadally think that in or\xadder to ex\xadplain why sci\xaden\xadtific the\xado\xadries can of\xadten pre\xaddict a wide range of differ\xadent phe\xadnom\xadena, we need to make claims about how well they de\xadscribe the struc\xadture of re\xadal\xadity—i.e. how true they are. But we should still use de\xadgrees of truth when do\xading so, be\xadcause even our most pow\xader\xadful sci\xaden\xadtific mod\xadels aren’t fully true. We know that gen\xaderal rel\xada\xadtivity isn’t fully true, for ex\xadam\xadple, be\xadcause it con\xadflicts with quan\xadtum me\xadchan\xadics. Even so, it would be ab\xadsurd to call gen\xaderal rel\xada\xadtivity false, be\xadcause it clearly de\xadscribes a ma\xadjor part of the struc\xadture of phys\xadi\xadcal re\xadal\xadity. Mean\xadwhile New\xadto\xadnian me\xadchan\xadics is fur\xadther away from the truth than gen\xaderal rel\xada\xadtivity, but still much closer to the truth than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_physics">Aris\xadtotelian me\xadchan\xadics</a>, which in turn is much closer to the truth than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism">an\xadi\xadmism</a>. The gen\xaderal point I’m try\xading to illus\xadtrate here was <a href="https://hermiene.net/essays-trans/relativity_of_wrong.html">ex\xadpressed pithily by Asi\xadmov</a>: “Think\xading that the Earth is flat is wrong. Think\xading that the Earth is a sphere is wrong. But if you think that they’re equally wrong, you’re wronger than both of them put to\xadgether.”</p><h3><strong>The cor\xadrect role of Bayesianism</strong></h3><p>The po\xadsi\xadtion I’ve de\xadscribed above over\xadlaps sig\xadnifi\xadcantly with the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structural-realism/"><i>struc\xadtural re\xadal\xadist</i></a> po\xadsi\xadtion in philos\xado\xadphy of sci\xadence. How\xadever, struc\xadtural re\xadal\xadism is usu\xadally viewed as a stance on how to in\xadter\xadpret sci\xaden\xadtific the\xado\xadries, rather than how to rea\xadson more gen\xader\xadally. So the philo\xadsoph\xadi\xadcal po\xadsi\xadtion which best cap\xadtures the ideas I’ve laid out is prob\xada\xadbly <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/#ProbKnowVeri">Karl Pop\xadper’s <i>crit\xadi\xadcal ra\xadtio\xadnal\xadism</i></a>.

But his at\xadtempt <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/Entries/truthlikeness/tichy-miller.html">failed on a tech\xadni\xadcal level</a>; and no at\xadtempt since then has gained wide\xadspread ac\xadcep\xadtance. Mean\xadwhile, the field of ma\xadchine learn\xading eval\xadu\xadates mod\xadels by their loss, which can be for\xadmally defined—but the loss of a model is heav\xadily de\xadpen\xaddent on the data dis\xadtri\xadbu\xadtion on which it’s eval\xadu\xadated. Per\xadhaps the most promis\xading ap\xadproach to as\xadsign\xading fuzzy truth-val\xadues comes from <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/y5GftLezdozEHdXkL/an-intuitive-guide-to-garrabrant-induction">Garrabrant in\xadduc\xadtion</a>, where the “money” earned by in\xaddi\xadvi\xadd\xadual traders could be in\xadter\xadpreted as a met\xadric of fuzzy truth.

Your task is to suggest 5 songs to add to a playlist based on the given mood and current playlist drawing inspiration from an article on how to make great playlists. Here\'s how to proceed:\n\nFirst, you will be provided with an articke "How to make a good playlist"\n\n<article>\nHow to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer\nDecember 8, 202012:03 AM ET\nBobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle\nThere\'s a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do\'s and don\'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I\'ve since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).\nIt\'s a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it\'s worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you\'re listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?\n"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR\'s Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he\'s performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.\n"A lot of us aren\'t great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.\nBut of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.\nFigure out what you\'re trying to accomplish\nLike speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?\nPlaylists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you\'re going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.\nSponsor Message\nThis is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!\nPick the songs\nOnce you\'ve got your mood in mind, now it\'s time to pick the songs. Don\'t be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you\'re going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It\'s fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they\'ll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).\nBobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you\'re not a professional DJ, he says there\'s no shame in cheating.\n"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.\nCrib from other peoples\' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it\'s all fair game.\nStructure the playlist like a flight\nGenerally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That\'s the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it\'s a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.\nFor instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye\'s "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It\'s nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He\'ll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.\nObviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.\nThis is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It\'s set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I\'m going for.\nSurprise!\nOne of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.\nOf course, "new" doesn\'t have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.\n\n\n</article>\n\nNext, you will be provided with two pieces of information:\n\n1. Mood: This is given as a PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) score. PANAS is a scale that measures the extent to which a person feels positive or negative emotions.\n\n<mood>\n{\'positive_affect\': {\'total_score\': 5, \'items\': {\'interested\': 3, \'excited\': 1, \'strong\': 0, \'enthusiastic\': 1, \'proud\': 0, \'alert\': 0, \'inspired\': 0, \'determined\': 0, \'attentive\': 0, \'active\': 0}}, \'negative_affect\': {\'total_score\': 45, \'items\': {\'distressed\': 10, \'upset\': 5, \'guilty\': 0, \'scared\': 0, \'hostile\': 5, \'irritable\': 0, \'ashamed\': 5, \'nervous\': 5, \'jittery\': 0, \'afraid\': 15}}}\n</mood>\n\n2. Current playlist: This is a list of songs currently in the playlist. It may be empty or contain up to 50 songs.\n\n<current_playlist>\nCurrent playlist:\n- Liability by Lorde\n- Yesterday - Remastered 2009 by The Beatles\n- Take Me to Church by Hozier\n- Skinny Love by Bon Iver\n- The Reason by Hoobastank\n- Lost Cause by Beck\n- Blackbird - Remastered 2009 by The Beatles\n- All I Want by Kodaline\n- In My Veins - Feat. Erin Mccarley by Andrew Belle\n- Both Sides Now by Joni Mitchell\n\n</current_playlist>\n\nYour goal is to suggest 5 songs that would fit well with the given mood and complement the existing playlist.\n\nTo generate your recommendations, follow these steps:\n1.

I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I\'ve since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).\nIt\'s a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it\'s worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you\'re listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?\n"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR\'s Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he\'s performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.\n"A lot of us aren\'t great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.\nBut of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.\nFigure out what you\'re trying to accomplish\nLike speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?\nPlaylists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you\'re going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.\nSponsor Message\nThis is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!\nPick the songs\nOnce you\'ve got your mood in mind, now it\'s time to pick the songs. Don\'t be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you\'re going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It\'s fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they\'ll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).\nBobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you\'re not a professional DJ, he says there\'s no shame in cheating.\n"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.\nCrib from other peoples\' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it\'s all fair game.\nStructure the playlist like a flight\nGenerally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That\'s the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it\'s a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.\nFor instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye\'s "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It\'s nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He\'ll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.\nObviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.\nThis is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It\'s set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I\'m going for.\nSurprise!\nOne of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.\nOf course, "new" doesn\'t have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.\n\n\n</article>\n\nNext, you will be provided with two pieces of information:\n\n1.

Your task is to suggest 5 instrumental pieces to add to a playlist based on the given mood and current playlist drawing inspiration from an article on how to make great playlists. Here\'s how to proceed:\nFirst, you will be provided with an article "How to make a good playlist"\n\n<article> How to make a good playlist: Tips from a Tiny Desk producer\nDecember 8, 202012:03 AM ET\nBobby Carter, Andrew Limbong, Andee Tagle\nThere\'s a scene in the 2000 movie High Fidelity where music snob and all-around unlikable jerk Rob (played by John Cusack) talks about the "do\'s and don\'ts" of making a great mixtape. I watched this movie before I was old enough to really understand that he was supposed to be an unlikable jerk, and as such, I\'ve since been obsessed with the idea of making a perfect playlist (or mix CD, or compilation tape, or whatever).\nIt\'s a fun way to think about your relationship to music, to find and share new music, and to revisit old nostalgic favorites, but it\'s worth asking — in the day and age of auto-generated playlists and streaming services keeping all sorts of tabs on what you\'re listening to, what is the point in making your own playlist?\n"No one knows exactly what you like like you do," says NPR\'s Bobby Carter. On top of producing Tiny Desk concerts for NPR Music, he\'s performed as DJ Cuzzin B for more than two decades and knows all there is to know about curating music. He says playlists are, in a way, their own language.\n"A lot of us aren\'t great with words, so why not let the song tell it?" says Bobby.\nBut of course, not everyone has decades of experience as a DJ or decades of experience being annoyingly into High Fidelity, so we here at Life Kit came up with a few tips on crafting the perfect playlist.\nFigure out what you\'re trying to accomplish\nLike speaking in any other foreign language, you need to know what you want to say. If the playlist is for yourself, Bobby suggests asking yourself a few questions: How do I feel right now? What am I going through? Am I looking to highlight that mood, or am I looking to get away from it?\nPlaylists have a way of connecting you to a certain feeling, so you want to be aware of what feeling you\'re going for. Over the summer, as people were protesting police violence and racism, Bobby says playlists of songs that spoke to social injustice helped keep him grounded with that movement. Alternately, his playlist for house cleaning leans more towards hits from Alanis Morisette and Kaytranada.\nSponsor Message\nThis is especially important if the playlist is for other people. The playlist you make for the chill family barbecue is going to be different from the one you make for that road trip you and your friends are taking, which is also going to be different from the one you make for the person you are crushing on. (Be careful with this last one! Take it from me, sometimes songs you think are communicating romance are, upon further reflection years down the line, actually maybe about cocaine?). Know your audience!\nPick the songs\nOnce you\'ve got your mood in mind, now it\'s time to pick the songs. Don\'t be intimidated by the vast library that is the history of recorded music. Just think of the mood or feeling you\'re going for, then jot down whichever songs take you there immediately. It\'s fine if they seem too obvious, or too on the nose — they\'ll help with the structure of the playlist as a whole (more on this in a bit!).\nBobby uses the app Shazam to keep track of songs he hears in the wild and then keeps tabs on playlists he might use them in. But if you\'re not a professional DJ, he says there\'s no shame in cheating.\n"If you need to go to another playlist and pick a few things, nothing wrong with that," he says.\nCrib from other peoples\' public playlists, compilation tapes, holiday CDs, movie soundtracks, whatever — it\'s all fair game.\nStructure the playlist like a flight\nGenerally speaking, a plane takes off, stays in the air for a bit, and then gently comes down. That\'s the arc you want to build your playlist around, says Bobby. Think about what role each song on your list performs, and from there it\'s a simple matter of arranging and connecting the dots. Having this structure in mind can help inspire more song picks, too, as your music brain will start slotting in different songs into different spots.\nFor instance: a club playlist from Bobby might start with Lucky Daye\'s "Roll Some Mo" (a perfect take-off song! It\'s nearly all build-up!), which sets him up for the sure-fire crowd pleasers. These can be the big hits from Beyoncé or Cameo or Lizzo, depending on where he wants the night to go. He\'ll stay in that zone for a bit, and then to descend, maybe some Drake? Or Marvin Gaye? From there Bobby can land on something smoother and moodier from Daniel Caesar, and call it a wrap.\nObviously, you can go up and down as you please, but having a frame of reference will keep you from overthinking it a bit.\nThis is, embarrassingly enough, the playlist I used to propose a few years ago. It\'s set up as two mini-flights, with the Fiona Apple song marking the end of Side A. I find compartmentalizing everything a bit helps me wrap my head around what feeling I\'m going for.\nSurprise!\nOne of the biggest joys of making and sharing playlists is introducing people to new music. But you want to nestle these in with some known entities. "That gives you more leeway to then go in with something new," says Bobby.\nOf course, "new" doesn\'t have to mean literally new. It could mean digging up an old gem or re-contextualizing seemingly unrelated songs. Either way, Bobby says a great playlist should have an element of surprise or wonder or discovery that elevates it beyond just a collection of solid tunes.\n\n </article>\n\nNext, you will be provided with two pieces of information:\n\nMood: This is given as a PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) score.
