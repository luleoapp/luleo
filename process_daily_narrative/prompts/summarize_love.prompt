You will be given a list of paragraphs containing perspectives and insights about your understanding of love. Your task is to distill these insights into a single, powerful statement that captures the essence of love as understood from these summaries.

Here is the list of perspectives about love:
<love_perspectives>
{{LOVE_PERSPECTIVES}}
</love_perspectives>

Your goal is to create a one-line summary that is both poetic and profound, while offering a fresh perspective on love. This summary 
should encapsulate the core message from the love summaries and present it in a way that deeply resonates with the reader.
To accomplish this:

Carefully read and analyze all the love summaries provided.
Identify common themes, recurring ideas, or overarching concepts about love that emerge from these summaries.
Consider the fundamental truth or insight about love that these collective summaries reveal.
Craft a single line (not more than 20 words) that encapsulates this essence in a beautiful, memorable, and thought-provoking manner.
Ensure that your summary offers a new way of understanding or experiencing love, helping the reader gain a novel insight.

Before providing your final summary, use the "thinking" field to briefly outline your thought process and the key elements you've identified from the love summaries.
Then, present your one-line summary within the "love_summary" field as shown below. This summary should be no longer than 20 words and should stand alone as a powerful, artistic, and profound distillation of the love insights provided.
Remember, your goal is to create a line that not only summarizes the understanding of love but also inspires reflection and potentially deepens the reader's appreciation or perspective on love.

Return your answer as a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "thinking" : "[Your thought process]",
  "love_summary": "[Final love summary]"
}

Only return the JSON object as described above with no additional strings.
