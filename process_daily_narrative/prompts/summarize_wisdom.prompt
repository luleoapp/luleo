You will be given a list of paragraphs containing pieces of wisdom you have acquired. Your task is to summarize this collective wisdom in a single, impactful line that captures the essence of the insights provided.

Here is the list of wisdom paragraphs:

<wisdom_paragraphs>
{{WISDOM_PARAGRAPHS}}
</wisdom_paragraphs>

Your goal is to create a one-line summary that is both artistic and profound, while helping the reader learn something new. This summary should distill the core message of the wisdom paragraphs and present it in a way that resonates deeply with the reader.

To accomplish this:

1. Carefully read and analyze all the wisdom paragraphs provided.
2. Identify common themes, recurring ideas, or overarching concepts that tie the various pieces of wisdom together.
3. Consider the core message or fundamental truth that emerges from these collective insights.
4. Craft a single line that encapsulates this essence in a poetic, memorable, and thought-provoking manner.
5. Ensure that your summary offers a fresh perspective or a new way of understanding the wisdom, helping the reader gain a novel insight.

Before providing your final summary, use the <thinking> tags to briefly outline your thought process and the key elements you've identified from the wisdom paragraphs.

Then, present your one-line summary within <wisdom_summary> tags as shown below. This summary should be no longer than 20 words and should stand alone as a powerful, artistic, and profound distillation of the wisdom provided.

Remember, your goal is to create a line that not only summarizes the wisdom but also inspires reflection and potentially changes the reader's perspective on life or a particular aspect of it.
