	•	4-7 points: Partially aligns with virtues.
	•	8-10 points: Exemplifies the highest virtues.

7. Innovation (5 points)

	•	Definition: Assesses the novelty and creativity of the idea.
	•	Scoring Guide:
	•	0-1 point: Commonplace or derivative idea.
	•	2-3 points: Moderately innovative with some new elements.
	•	4-5 points: Highly innovative and groundbreaking.

8. Scalability (5 points)

	•	Definition: Evaluates the potential to expand the idea from a small scale to a larger one.
	•	Scoring Guide:
	•	0-1 point: Limited to a small scale.
	•	2-3 points: Scalable with significant adjustments.
	•	4-5 points: Easily scalable across various contexts.

9. Urgency (5 points)

	•	Definition: Determines how pressing the need is for this idea.
	•	Scoring Guide:
	•	0-1 point: Low urgency; can be deferred.
	•	2-3 points: Moderate urgency.
	•	4-5 points: Immediate action required.

Potential Deductions

10. Unintended Consequences (Up to -10 points)

	•	Definition: Assesses the risk of negative side effects or harm resulting from the idea.
	•	Deduction Guide:
	•	0 points deducted: Minimal risk.
	•	1-5 points deducted: Moderate risk with manageable consequences.
	•	6-10 points deducted: High risk of significant negative outcomes.

11. Resource Requirements (Up to -5 points)

	•	Definition: Evaluates the extent of resources needed (financial, human, environmental).
	•	Deduction Guide:
	•	0 points deducted: Requires minimal resources.
	•	1-3 points deducted: Requires considerable resources.
	•	4-5 points deducted: Demands excessive resources beyond practical limits.

Total Score Calculation

	1.	Add up the points from criteria 1-9.
	2.	Subtract any deductions from criteria 10-11.
	3.	Final Score: The result is the overall score out of 100.

Example Evaluation

Idea: Implementing a Global Education Platform Accessible to All

	1.	Positive Impact: 22/25
	2.	Feasibility: 13/15
	3.	Inclusivity & Equity: 14/15
	4.	Sustainability: 9/10
	5.	Ethical Soundness: 10/10
	6.	Alignment with Virtues: 10/10
	7.	Innovation: 4/5
	8.	Scalability: 5/5
	9.	Urgency: 5/5

	•	Subtotal: 92/100

Deductions:

	10.	Unintended Consequences: -2 points (Minor risks of digital divide)
	11.	Resource Requirements: -3 points (Significant initial investment)

	•	Total Deductions: -5 points

Final Score: 92 - 5 = 87/100

Interpretation of the Score

	•	80-100: Exceptional idea with high potential to make the world a better place.
	•	60-79: Good idea with some areas needing improvement.
	•	40-59: Fair idea but requires significant adjustments.
	•	Below 40: Idea has major issues and is not recommended in its current form.

Conclusion

This scoring mechanism provides a structured and comprehensive way to evaluate ideas based on their potential to contribute positively to the world, their practicality, and alignment with humanity’s highest virtues. It ensures that each idea is assessed fairly, with clear guidelines for scoring and deductions.
